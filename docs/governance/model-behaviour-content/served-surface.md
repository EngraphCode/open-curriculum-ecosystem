# What an agent sees today

> **Generated file — do not edit by hand.** It is rebuilt from the content registry by `pnpm --filter @oaknational/agent-tools build-mcp-content-workspace`. Editing a page here changes nothing an agent sees; change the source file each item names.

Not everything in this codebase is switched on. Some tools and documents are deliberately retained but not offered to agents — kept so they can be turned back on as a single reviewed change, rather than deleted and rewritten later.

A **live** surface is one an agent can use right now. A **dormant** surface exists in the code but is not offered, so no agent can reach it and its wording cannot affect anyone until it is switched on.

### Prompts — capability absent; listing not offered (method not found)

## How this is worked out

One file decides it: `apps/oak-curriculum-mcp-streamable-http/src/served-surface/served-surface.ts` classifies every tool and resource as live or dormant, and the server registers from that one definition. Turning a surface on or off is a one-word change there, reviewed like any other change.

The live lists above are recorded by starting the server and asking it what it offers, so they are evidence of what is actually registered. The dormant lists are read from that file, and the same run checks that none of those names is offered. The `validate-mcp-content-current-source` check keeps that record honest against the code.
