# OCE architecture: one framework, configurable instances

**Edition 1, 10 October 2026.** [ADR-233](architectural-decisions/233-retained-framework-and-configurable-instances.md)
owns the settled direction. This document owns the proposed implementation
architecture and its open invariant register. It is sufficient to understand the
programme without private chat or research-library access. It describes a target,
not a completed reorganisation.

OCE is the retained capability innovation framework: the place to construct,
compose, investigate, qualify and maintain reusable capabilities and services.
Published packages expose supported portions of that framework. External apps
select instance behaviour; OCE supplies the mechanisms that make those selections
work. Neither a catalogue of packages nor the current MCP application bounds OCE.

## The distinct architectural dimensions

| Dimension                  | Governing question                                              | Consequence                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Capability responsibility  | What complete guarantee does a consumer receive?                | Define it before choosing a package. One package can deliver several cohesive units; one service can compose many packages.                               |
| CF grade and assurance     | What does a unit rely on, and what evidence justifies reliance? | Primitive independence, Component/Subsystem composition and qualification are separate from publication.                                                  |
| Context and semantic layer | Which meanings and policies does the capability own?            | General foundations support domain capabilities; specialised domains and projections preserve their own semantics. No global number of layers is imposed. |
| Source custody             | Where are mechanisms authored and maintained?                   | OCE retains all reusable mechanisms. A domain-specific mechanism can still be reusable.                                                                   |
| Distribution               | What immutable supported artefact does a consumer install?      | Public exports, licences, dependency closure and compatibility are deliberate contracts.                                                                  |
| Runtime and instance       | Where and under whose authority is it executed?                 | Several configured services, stores or indexes may consume the same mechanisms. Source co-location does not mandate co-deployment.                        |
| Product authority          | Who chooses purposes and permitted behaviour?                   | A configuration selects within delegated powers; it cannot enlarge them. Dait and Clef remain distinct consumers and programmes.                          |

The former `core` directory is a current physical arrangement, not the target
architecture. Its ten workspaces have [explicit reconstruction dispositions](foundations/oce-cf-reconstruction.md).
The two-family toolkit/Oak distinction remains useful for dependency direction
and identity separation; it is not a requirement to force every capability into a
predetermined new directory count. Choose responsibility and public contract,
then a supported physical location, then move consumers and retire the old home.

## Logical responsibility map

  F["CF units and complete compositions"] --> G["General mechanisms"]

```

Arrows show allowed construction or consumption, not a mandatory synchronous
request chain. All boxes above external instance configuration are maintained in
OCE. An external app references the published runner; it does not reimplement
that runner. Provider integrations supply effects behind owned interfaces. A
public API, SDK and MCP surface can share domain capabilities without forcing
every internal call through a network API. Generated distribution is a view of
an identified source, not another editing authority.

The package closure for an MCP instance includes its actual host/authentication,
tools/resources, curriculum access, search/graph clients, presentation, telemetry,
configuration and build/release needs. It is discovered from imports and supported
behaviour, not from today's folder boundaries. Provider credentials are acquired
at explicit execution boundaries. No package may discover a monorepo root or read
ambient deployment configuration on import.

## Open invariant register

**A** means explicit owner direction, **H** an inherited accepted obligation,
and **D** a derived proposed obligation of this design. A D row is not a fabricated
owner ratification. Evidence below is required future software/design evidence;
none is claimed delivered by writing this register. Discovery remains open.

I07–I20 refine obligations that the initial baseline did not fully express. In
particular, version composition, correction/deletion propagation, activation
coherence, privacy of diagnostics and execution authority during migration emerge
from following complete paths rather than checking isolated package boundaries.

## Interactions that determine the design

**Expressiveness and authority (I02/I09/I14).** A tiny environment-variable set
cannot describe ordinary product variation. An unrestricted programming language
would move mechanisms into apps. The proposed middle is a family of typed
declarative contracts: registered capability selections, bounded composition,
policy profiles and constrained parameters. OCE owns validation, execution and
diagnostics. A new operation adds a reviewed OCE capability; changing its approved
parameters does not. This is a design choice to test against the adverse scenarios.

**Layered models and integrity (I05/I06/I07).** A projection can omit irrelevant
information while preserving every distinction its consumers require. Record its
purpose, source revisions and permitted loss; do not assert reversibility where
none exists. Source corrections must still be traceable across the projection.
The existing API generator is not automatically the authority for newly authored
curriculum-domain or learner models.

**CF first and independent delivery (I03/I04/I20).** Lead with the established
geometry-to-heap route and affected reusable foundations. Contract design and
publishing can advance alongside it. An external app needs its supported package
closure, not every eventual CF unit. An interim supported package retains an
explicit reconstruction home and an honest assurance status; sequencing cannot
lower the promised guarantee.

**Retained source and independent release (I01/I10/I13/I18).** The monorepo is the
coherent authoring home. Packages, config versions, source snapshots and instances
can evolve on different clocks. Assess supported combinations and carry their
identities together; do not invent a global release transaction. Initial package
publication retains the existing one-repository-version policy.

**Preservation and retirement (I01/I17).** Preserve useful material, rationale and
behaviour, not duplicate active implementations. A source/disposition record maps
every moved mechanism to its maintained home, fixtures and replacement contract.
Git history preserves historical source; active consumers use one maintained path.

**Castr and CF independence.** Castr's current proposed destination preserves its
ability to stand alone. Integrating its source into OCE does not itself authorise
imports from arbitrary OCE units. The [Castr contract](oce-integrity-and-castr.md)
names the exact decision before a shared-foundation dependency is introduced.

## Full-framework responsibilities and present provision

These are architecture coverage obligations, not a commission to deliver the full
capability catalogue in one migration. A responsibility can be supported by several

Dait's current needs and Clef's wider requirements are not interchangeable.
This public architecture incorporates the generic owner-authorised obligations:
the retained innovation framework, layered curriculum capabilities and end-to-end
integrity. Restricted programme briefings, people and schedules are not replicated.
Any product-specific obligation needed to execute a future slice must be expressed
in an approved contract before that slice relies on it; it is never guessed from
another programme's technology choices.

## Detailed contracts and unresolved decisions

Use [configuration contracts](oce-configuration-contracts.md) for supported
variation and desk scenarios, [integrity and Castr](oce-integrity-and-castr.md) for
source-to-consumer obligations, [CF reconstruction](foundations/oce-cf-reconstruction.md)
for construction/qualification, and [instance development](../development/oce-instance-development.md)
for consumption and handover. The native planning index routes their delivery.

Open decisions have bounded homes in those specifications and the programme design
report: configuration representation and composition limits; actual public package
closure; new domain/source contract authority; Castr profile and model strategy;
compatible release combinations; runtime/index sharing; distribution promotion;
and specific adoption of the later CF architecture proposals. A missing decision
blocks only its dependent implementation. None reopens the settled retained-OCE
boundary or justifies another programme-wide inventory.

The [wider capability account](oce-wider-capabilities.md) preserves the B01–B16
build map and four worked domain records beyond the first public instances.
It gives authoring/publication, tuition, research, interoperability, evaluation,
evidence and accepted remedy their own authority and finite contract homes.

## Alternatives and conditions for reopening

The serious alternative within the settled direction is a smaller family of
product-specific configuration contracts over shared packages, rather than a
generic composition language. Prefer that smaller shape until a concrete scenario
requires cross-capability composition. Conversely, an environment-only shell
fails the required policy/composition scenarios and must be expanded.

An extraction-first sequence can deliver earlier ownership only after its package
closure is supported and published. With no handover deadline supplied, it does
not displace CF-first. Waiting for all CF would delay unrelated usable contracts
without establishing an actual dependency. Reopen that ordering on a documented
handover constraint or a demonstrated foundational dependency, not a speculative
estimate of team speed.

One shared search service can be useful where consumers deliberately share data,
authority and operating requirements. The architecture also supports separate
instances; possible future consumers alone do not choose between them. Source
custody, capability conformance and eventual educational benefit remain distinct
claims throughout.
