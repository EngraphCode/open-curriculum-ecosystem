# Architecture

**Last Updated**: 2026-11-13
**Status**: Active architectural index

## Start Here

The architecture exists to turn Oak's openly licenced, fully sequenced and
resourced curriculum into reusable primitives: generated SDKs, MCP and MCP App
surfaces, hybrid semantic search, knowledge graph integration, and the
OpenAPI-to-MCP pipeline that lets those pieces be reused inside and beyond Oak.

The proposed rearchitecting direction has its own pages:
[ADR-233](architectural-decisions/233-retained-framework-and-configurable-instances.md),
[OCE architecture and open invariants](oce-architecture.md),
[CF reconstruction](foundations/oce-cf-reconstruction.md),
[instance contracts](oce-configuration-contracts.md) and
[integrity and Castr](oce-integrity-and-castr.md). This page describes the implemented
structure.

1. **→ OpenAPI Pipeline Architecture** ([openapi-pipeline.md](./openapi-pipeline.md)) — **read this first** to understand the core pattern.
2. **→ Current Architecture Overview** (this page) — standard structure and boundaries.
3. **→ [ADR index](./architectural-decisions/)** — the architectural source of truth; start from the ADRs listed below.

The foundational ADRs that shape the entire codebase — the canonical
[Start Here: 5 ADRs in 15 Minutes](./architectural-decisions/README.md#start-here-5-adrs-in-15-minutes)
block in the ADR index:

- [ADR-029](./architectural-decisions/029-no-manual-api-data.md) — No manual API data structures
- [ADR-030](./architectural-decisions/030-sdk-single-source-truth.md) — SDK as single source of truth
- [ADR-031](./architectural-decisions/031-generation-time-extraction.md) — Generation-time extraction
- [ADR-048](./architectural-decisions/048-shared-parse-schema-helper.md) — Shared parsing helper pattern
- [ADR-107](./architectural-decisions/107-deterministic-sdk-nl-in-mcp-boundary.md) — Deterministic SDK and NL boundary

## Architectural invariants

Six stable, ADR-backed properties make this repository what it is. Each links to its authoritative doc, which always carries the detail:

1. **The SDK updates itself from the API spec** — when the upstream OpenAPI schema changes, regeneration brings every workspace into alignment with zero manual type work (the [Cardinal Rule](../../.agent/directives/principles.md#cardinal-rule-of-this-repository); [OpenAPI pipeline](./openapi-pipeline.md)).
2. **Two data feeds, both deliberate** — the live API powers the SDK and MCP tools ([OpenAPI pipeline](./openapi-pipeline.md)), while bulk-downloaded curriculum data is the source of truth for search ingestion and graph derivation ([semantic search architecture](../agent-guidance/semantic-search-architecture.md)).
3. **The curriculum graphs are derived from the bulk data** — prior knowledge, misconceptions, keywords, and progressions served as anchored graph tools ([graph-stack topology, ADR-173](./architectural-decisions/173-graph-stack-topology.md)).
4. **EEF evidence grounds the pedagogy** — the Teaching and Learning Toolkit is integrated for evidence-based support ([Data Sources](../../README.md#data-sources)).
5. **The bulk data populates the semantic search** — ingestion builds the search indices from it ([ingestion guide](../../apps/oak-search-cli/docs/INGESTION-GUIDE.md)).
6. **The Search SDK serves both sides** — creating and operating search instances as well as querying them ([Search SDK](../../packages/sdks/oak-search-sdk/README.md)).

## Reference Documentation

### Core Architecture (Current)

- Foundations-first architecture: the
  [software projection of the cost-of-change gradient](./foundations-first.md)
  — how core building blocks, foundational systems, libraries, and products
  concentrate recurring mechanism and assurance at the lowest coherent layer.
  The [general pattern](../foundation/cost-of-change-gradient.md) also applies
  across human-agent systems, inquiry, and the Practice.
- Algorithm and data-structure foundations (a documented direction; no
  implementation has landed yet): [ADR-230](./architectural-decisions/230-own-built-algorithm-and-data-structure-foundations.md)
  records the owner-established direction to author Capability Foundations:
  small completed Primitives and meaningful compositions, informed by openly
  licensed references. The
  [governing policy](./foundations/algorithms-and-data-structures-governance-2026-09-08.md)
  owns scope, research and qualification; the [bundle index](./foundations/foundations-bundle-index-2026-09-08.md)
  locates the graph and non-graph contracts, requirements and worked examples.
- Standard structure:
  - `apps/` – application runtimes (MCP servers, search CLI)
  - `packages/sdks/` – SDK packages (`@oaknational/curriculum-sdk`, `@oaknational/oak-search-sdk`)
  - `packages/core/` – foundational shared code and provider-neutral primitives (result/env/observability/eslint/openapi adapter)
  - `packages/libs/` – shared runtime libraries; the foundation/adapter tier membership is enumerated in [ADR-041](architectural-decisions/041-workspace-structure-option-a.md), the single source for it (this line stopped restating the list after drifting four packages behind it)
- Boundaries enforced by custom ESLint rules in `packages/core/oak-eslint`
- Provider composition is app-local (logger/clock/storage/search retrieval), then injected into server/tool layers
- Apps load runtime config at entry boundaries and inject dependencies (DI) into servers and tools
- A universal MCP translation layer (generated in the SDK) normalises tool inputs/outputs so the canonical Streamable HTTP transport (`/mcp`) — and any future stdio entry point generalised from it — share the same schema-derived contract
- **Key implementation detail**: All MCP tools are generated at compile time from the OpenAPI schema - see [Programmatic Tool Generation](./programmatic-tool-generation.md) and [OpenAPI Pipeline](./openapi-pipeline.md)
- Provider architecture: see [Provider System](./provider-system.md) and [Provider Contracts](./provider-contracts.md)
- Getting started: see the [root README Quick Start](../../README.md#quick-start)

#### Rules & Relationships

- Inter‑workspace imports in production source use `@oaknational/*` package
  specifiers only. Explicit test/config lint carve-outs remain allowed where
  repo-root tooling or fixtures require them.
- Intra‑package relative imports are allowed; avoid private/internal subpaths.
- Dependencies flow: `core` has no monorepo dependencies outside `core` (intra-core dependencies are permitted, and external dependencies must remain minimal and provider-neutral); foundation `libs` depend on `core`, with `search-contracts` as the documented exception that may consume approved `@oaknational/sdk-codegen` subpath exports; adapter `libs` may depend on foundation `libs` plus `core`; `sdks` depend on `core`/`libs` and approved generated SDK surfaces (for example runtime/search consume `@oaknational/sdk-codegen` exports per ADR-108, not direct `oak-search-sdk` → `curriculum-sdk` imports); `apps` depend on `sdks`/`libs`/`core`.
- **Core package decomposition principle**: when splitting a core package that has acquired runtime dependencies, schemas and type-level code stay in `core`; the runtime pipeline moves to `libs`. This preserves core's provider-neutral, minimal-dependency constraint.

## Implementation Plans

Implementation plans are execution artefacts, not canonical architecture
documentation. Durable decisions belong in ADRs; plan-path provenance belongs
in plans and session notes.

## Historical Context

Prior architectural states retained for traceability — evidence trails
cited from current ADRs, not current guidance. See
[historical/README.md](./historical/README.md) for scope and
contents. Do not read these to learn how the system works today.

## Related Design Space

  documents that sit between session observations and committed ADRs.
  Some inform ADRs that live in this directory; others inform plans
  that live under `.agent/plans/`.
