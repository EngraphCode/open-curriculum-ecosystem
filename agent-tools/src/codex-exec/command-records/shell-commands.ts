/**
 * The commands a harness argv means, read through the estate's shell
 * segmenter (the Claude Bash guard's, under `src/shell`): the argv itself
 * when no shell in it runs a script, else every simple command of the script
 * that shell is given (`sh -c`, `bash -lc`, `bash -euo pipefail -c`,
 * `/bin/zsh -lc`; every operand of `eval` and `ssh`), each lifted through the
 * same front door again, and the body of every command substitution any word
 * carries (`$(…)`, a backtick pair, the substitutions of an unquoted
 * here-document body), to a bounded depth. The segmenter removes quotes
 * (`$'…'` included), drops `#` comments and here-document bodies, and reads a
 * redirection as its own word, so an option after or glued to one belongs to
 * its command.
 *
 * The interpreter is found anywhere in a segment, as the guard finds it: a
 * shell behind `sudo` is read, and so is `echo bash -c 'git push'`, which
 * lifts a command that never ran and fails closed. Only a script word with
 * whitespace in it is re-read, since a one-word script carries no two-word
 * shape. At the depth limit a segment is still a command, flag-scanned as it
 * stands, never dropped. Nothing is expanded: a word an expansion would
 * produce, a shape behind `xargs` or `find -exec`, a git alias and an
 * abbreviated long option are residuals of this reader.
