/**
 * Optional statusline payload logging, enabled by `OAK_STATUSLINE_LOG_FILE`.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Diagnostic instrument for the statusline's one blind spot: the adapter can
 * prove what it renders from a payload, but not what payload the harness
 * actually sent (e.g. whether `rate_limits` ever arrives — the MCP-529
 * founding case). When the environment variable names a `*.log` path, every
 * invocation appends one timestamped line carrying the payload as received —
 * only line breaks are collapsed (one invocation, one greppable line); all
 * other bytes, including internal whitespace, are preserved. When unset,
 * behaviour is byte-identical to before this module existed.
 *
 * Failure posture is split the same way as the adapter's own segments:
 *
 * - **A set-but-invalid value is a misconfiguration and fails LOUD.** An
 *   operator who explicitly set the variable must never read silence as "the
 *   harness sent nothing" — the resolver returns an `invalid` config whose
 *   warning the adapter renders as a visible token.
 * - **Write failures are swallowed.** The statusline is a soft surface — its
 *   own diagnostics must never blank or break it. This is the same documented
 *   posture as the frame store (`statusline-frame-store.ts`), and the narrow
 *   sanctioned exception to the Result-pattern rule: the append returns a
 *   Result, and this fire-and-forget adapter boundary discards it, because
 *   there is no caller to hand it to.
 *
 * Destinations are `*.log` only — an environment variable that drives a file
 * append deserves a small blast radius. The append itself is the shared
 * owner-only append (`core/owner-only-append.ts`). The log directory and file
 * are created private to the user (0o700 / 0o600), and the destination is
 * treated as a boundary: symlinks refuse to open, non-regular files
 * (FIFOs, devices) never receive a write, a file another user owns or with a
 * second hard link refuses rather than leaks (so a root-run statusline will
 * not append to another user's log), and a pre-existing file of the user's
 * own is retightened to owner-only before each append. A directory the path
 * names that already exists keeps its permissions (mkdir's mode applies at
 * creation only; the statusline never re-modes a directory a user names, so
 * a log under `/tmp` works), and the payload carries session ids and project
 * paths — prefer a private directory and delete the log after diagnosis.
