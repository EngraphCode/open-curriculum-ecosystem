/**
 * The rule-name boundary of the sweep, in both directions. A rule is addressed by its basename
 * without `.md`, and every path the sweep builds (`.agent/rules/<name>.md`,
 * `.cursor/rules/<name>.mdc`, `.claude/rules/<name>.md`) interpolates that name, so any other
 * shape (a separator anywhere, leading or not; a dot segment; an empty name; a `.md` suffix)
 * would address a file outside the rules directories or the wrong file inside them, and the
 * projection leg interpolates it into code spans, table cells and paths besides, so the shape
 * is closed: lowercase letters and digits in single-hyphen groups, nothing a code span, a
 * table cell or a path cannot carry (the #74 round-three finding, 2026-09-14). The check
 * runs before any path is built, so a refused name is never read and never written; the reason
 * quotes the name so an empty or whitespace name stays visible in a report. In the other
 * direction, the rules index is the canonical enumeration, so a row naming no swept rule is a
 * stale or extra row the sweep would never visit, and it refuses the sweep too, before any
 * rule path is built (the index itself has been read by then).
