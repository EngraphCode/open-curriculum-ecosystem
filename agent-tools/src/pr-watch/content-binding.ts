/**
 * Whether a review binds the pull request's head: exactly (it reviewed the
 * head commit), or by content (the commit it reviewed carries the same patch
 * against the base as the head does, as after a pure sync: a merge of the
 * base that leaves the pull request's own patch unchanged).
 *
 * @remarks
 * A leg bound to the exact head commit is re-opened by every sync merge,
 * although the content it reviewed has not changed. The content of a commit
 * is its patch against the base (`merge-base(base, commit)..commit`),
 * compared by `git patch-id --verbatim`, which ignores commit ids, index
 * lines and hunk offsets but not whitespace. Equal ids bind; any other
 * answer, or an id that could not be read, leaves the review unbound and the
 * leg as it was. No merge-commit structure is inspected, so the claim does
 * not depend on how the sync was made. The limit is a decision: a sync that
 * changes a file the pull request also touches, with the pull request's
 * hunks re-applied identically, still binds; the reviewer's verdict is on
 * the same hunks against new context, and the head's checks cover the
 * context (`.agent/reports/agentic-engineering/2026-09-26-sync-lineage-binding-design.md`).
 * Pure: the reader supplies the ids.
