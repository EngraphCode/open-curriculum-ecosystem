/**
 * The gh IO composition for `pr state`: one extended `pr view` call, the
 * review-threads GraphQL slurp (shared with `pr-watch`), four FULL paginated
 * harvests — `reviews` (the reviewer-leg source, never the `latestReviews`
 * pointer), `comments` and `commits` (the completion-comment sources), and
 * the request events (the rounds a review bound by content waits for) — and
 * the `gh agent-task` review-run legs, composed into one {@link PrStateReading}.
 *
 * The expected reviewer set is a DECLARED input (`expectedReviewers`); when
 * undeclared it defaults to the observed surface (requests ∪ harvest authors)
 * and the reading marks `expectedDeclared: false` so the verdict names the
 * first-round-guarantee gap instead of silently passing it.
 *
 * The `gh agent-task` review-run leg (bounded run→PR mapping, typed
 * degradation) lives in `review-runs.ts`. The content leg (`content-reader.ts`)
 * reads the patch-ids a review of an earlier commit binds the head by, and
 * degrades to unproven, never failing the reading.
