/**
 * Derive the install-time build closure from the workspace manifests.
 *
 * The closure is every workspace package the bootstrap's own package reaches
 * over workspace edges (dependencies, devDependencies and peerDependencies,
 * followed transitively) whose entry points name built output under `dist/`:
 * nothing can import such a package on a cold checkout until it is built. The
 * members are ordered so each builds after the members it reaches, since a
 * package's own build (its `tsup.config.ts`) may import a sibling. The
 * bootstrap's own package is never a member; its compiler runs after the
 * closure.
 *
 * Rooted, not workspace-wide: a workspace-wide closure would build every
 * dist-only package at install time, including product libraries whose builds
 * need generated code or a recipe the bootstrap does not run. A member whose
 * build script is not the one recipe the bootstrap runs is refused by name
 * rather than built wrongly.
 *
 * The list is computed, never kept: the hand-kept list it replaces missed the
 * ESLint plugin every lint config imports, so a worktree could not lint after
 * `pnpm install` alone. Two cold-install failures in this repository came from
 * the same class (PR #393, 2026-07-16, and PR #836, 2026-08-09), and a third in
 * the second estate's own repository (2026-09-13), where this derivation was
 * first written.
 *
 * This module runs before any workspace package is built, so it imports none
 * of them: the verdict is a local union rather than `@oaknational/result`
 * (ADR-088's shape), and record iteration is a local helper rather than
 * `@oaknational/type-helpers`. Manifests are validated with zod at the
 * boundary (ADR-032) in `install-time-manifest.ts`; the reader that walks the workspace is
 * `install-time-closure-io.ts`, injected as data (ADR-078).
