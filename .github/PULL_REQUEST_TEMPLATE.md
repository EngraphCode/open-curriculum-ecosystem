## Summary

<!-- What changed? Describe the coherent outcome, not the file list. -->

## Why

<!-- What problem does this solve, who or what benefits, and why now? -->

## Review focus

<!-- Where should reviewers spend attention? Name important decisions or assumptions. -->

## Scope

<!--
State what is deliberately in and out of this PR. This section is the review contract:
reviewers test findings against it, and a finding whose proposed remedy falls outside it is
dispositioned by pr-lifecycle §Phase 4 (the remedy is discarded; the observation is still
priced on PDR-140's bar).
On a prose- or records-class changeset, and on a mixed one whose prose findings PDR-140
governs, also declare the intake: the artefact class, its next verification point, the
worthiness-bar reading that follows, and the settlement-push budget.

## Validation

<!--
Give reproducible evidence for the final diff: commands and results, manual
checks, screenshots, or a reason a validation type is not applicable.
-->

## Risks and rollout

<!--
Describe compatibility, migration, deployment, monitoring, rollback, or
follow-up considerations. Write "None" when there are no relevant risks.
