/**
 * Which requests to the MCP endpoint belong to its fully public browser leg.
 *
 * ## Why This Exists
 *
 * The web page at `/mcp` is public unconditionally by owner ruling (MCP-518),
 * while the MCP server on the same URL follows the coded OAuth flow. The auth
 * contract is per-surface, so deciding which surface a request belongs to has
 * to be the FIRST auth-relevant act — not something that happens after the
 * auth vendor has already inspected the request and possibly answered it.
 *
 * This module is that decision, kept apart from both consumers: the
 * negotiation that serves the page (`mcp-middleware.ts`) and the conditional
 * that keeps Clerk off it (`conditional-clerk-middleware.ts`). It is where
 * the one vendor-specific fact in the fork lives, so the negotiation stays
 * free of any knowledge of who is authenticating.
 *
 * @see mcp-middleware.ts — `selectsHtmlLeg`, the serving half of the fork
 * @see conditional-clerk-middleware.ts — the skip half
 */

 * `HandshakeService.isRequestEligibleForHandshake` in `@clerk/backend@3.16.1`
 * forces the redirect handshake for a GET when `Sec-Fetch-Dest` is `document`
 * or `iframe`, or — with that header absent — when `Accept` starts with
 * `text/html`. Re-read this list against the vendor on a version bump: it is
 * a copy of somebody else's condition, and the copy is what goes stale.

 * mounted ahead of the auth-enforced routes — so a request without it can
 * never reach a handler that reads auth state. Matching the raw header

/**
 * True for a request to the MCP endpoint's fully public browser leg.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Two clauses, and both are needed:
 *
 * 1. {@link selectsHtmlLeg} — the SAME predicate the negotiation serves the
 *    page by, imported rather than restated, so what bypasses auth and what
 *    receives the page cannot drift apart.
 * 2. A document or iframe navigation the vendor finds handshake-eligible even
 *    though the negotiation will not serve it: `Sec-Fetch-Dest` says
 *    navigation while `Accept` names no HTML type. Clause 1 alone would be
 *    narrower than the class the vendor redirects, which is the defect
 *    MCP-518 exists to close.
 *
 * The protocol leg is excluded first and unconditionally: a request naming
 * `text/event-stream` keeps its auth machinery however browser-shaped it
 * otherwise looks. That is what stops this predicate from becoming a way to
 * reach the MCP handler with no auth context — which `getAuth` cannot
 * survive, so it would be an outage rather than a bypass.
 *
 * @param req - Method and negotiation headers, read off the request
 * @returns true when the request is a public page view, never protocol traffic
