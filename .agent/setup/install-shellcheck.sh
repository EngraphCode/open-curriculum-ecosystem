# Install the shellcheck that the root `lint:shell` gate runs, pinned by
# version and by the sha256 of each host's release asset and of the binary in
# it, into this repository's own .tools/bin (ignored by git). CI
# (.github/workflows/ci.yml), the cloud session hook (cloud-session-setup.sh
# beside this file) and the root postinstall bootstrap outside CI and Vercel
# all install it here. The run is a no-op when .tools/bin/shellcheck already
# has the pinned binary's sha256, and nothing there runs before its sha256 is
# checked. The gate runs .tools/bin/shellcheck
# before any shellcheck on PATH, so a checkout never shares the binary with
# another repository's pin. shellcheck versions differ in what they report, so
# the pin lives here once: the gate reads SHELLCHECK_VERSION from this file and
# fails when the shellcheck it runs is another version. Moving the pin means
# changing the version and every digest together: each archive digest
# recomputed from a download and cross-checked against the `digest` GitHub's
# release API records for that asset, and each binary digest recomputed from
# the binary extracted from that checked archive.
#
# Usage: install-shellcheck.sh

# The bash floor: the shellcheck gate holds it once and requires this guard first.
