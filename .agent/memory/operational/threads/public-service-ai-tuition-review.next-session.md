# Thread: public-service-ai-tuition-review

**Purpose**: One review lane over PR 66, the ADR-226 import of the 17-file public-service AI
tuition research collection: import fidelity the PR's own validation surface cannot see, an audit
of the published author-lineage review, and the owner's decisions returned as one packet with
factors. Single-PR thread; retires with a banner when the lane PR merges.

## Participating agent identities (PDR-027)

| agent_name | platform | model | session_id_prefix | role | first_session | last_session |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jackal wakes Nocturne | claude-code | claude-fable-5-1 | 3484b6 | implementer — the whole lane: plan (fleet-design-reviewed, owner-approved in-session), seat-side mechanical legs, frame gate and audit fleet, report, one typed review on PR 66, node and this record; claim `60d6d916` | 2026-09-06 | 2026-09-07 |
| Cricket weaves Burrow | claude-code | claude-fable-5-1 | f8f302 | implementer — the substance review of the collection from Jackal's brief: two typed reviews on PR 66, the report's "Second pass", `AUTHORITY.md` pointers, this record's RESUME 4; claim `f08ac8d9` | 2026-09-07 | 2026-09-07 |

## Current Continuation

**Current state (2026-09-07 ~14:0xZ; the authoritative block is RESUME 4 at the foot of this
record — read it before anything below):** the lane's records live on PR 66's branch
(`docs/public-service-ai-tuition-2026-09-06`, the owner's PR), pushed as the bot. Both passes are
done: the import-and-warrant review (Jackal, reviews 5126608127 and 5126692305) and the substance
review (Cricket, reviews 5132463698 and 5132534231). All three owner facts are ruled and applied.
What remains: PR 66's landing and its PDR-140 intake declaration (the owner's); the node's
remaining gate (a plan node and parent for the chapter-13 programme, the Director's to carry);
answering any further review round on the lane's own files; the retirement banner when PR 66
merges. No audit, report drafting, review posting or lane PR is outstanding — the bullets below
are the first seat's pickup state at 2026-09-06, kept for history.

- **Branch**: `review/pr66-tuition-collection`, cut from `origin/engraph` at SHA:341477368 in the
  sibling worktree `oak-open-curriculum-ecosystem-worktrees/review-pr66` (bot identity inherited,
  no worktree-scoped override; installed and built). Since RESUME 3 the branch tracks PR 66's
  head; the worktree stays for the successor.
- **Invocation pointer**: the owner's verbatim ask in the seat's own session (2026-09-06 ~19:3xZ):
  "please carry out a deep review of PR 66 /oak-parallax use all relevant cognitive and planning
  skills ultrathink /oak-plan"; later owner words to this seat: "refer permissions requests to the
  Director"; "Review the state of each of your subagents, and step back and use /oak-metacognition
  /oak-free-play /oak-concept-exploration /oak-reason /oak-parallax". Overnight contract from the
  Director (event 20:51:38Z): questions to the Director; Cricket panel at boundaries and hourly;
  non-terminal wrap after landings and every two hours; slots #58, #67, this lane, the fold.
- **Controlling plan**:
  [`public-service-ai-tuition-review.plan.md`](../../../plans/delivery/public-service-ai-tuition-review.plan.md)
  (born sketch, authored at pickup). The machine-local session plan (revision 2, fleet-design
  review verdicts attached) is the seat's working copy; the node is its repo twin.
- **Next safe step (superseded — see RESUME 4)**: at pickup this read "absorb the frame gate and
  the R1–R7 audit, run the tip checks, draft the report, post the review, open the lane PR"; every
  item is done and the lane PR shape was overturned by the owner (records on PR 66's branch).
- **Completed prerequisites**: foundation complete; team-start broadcast (event `f827086f`);
  claim `60d6d916` open with role implementer; watcher and two-leg heartbeat live from the
  primary; Director ACK with no redirect (event `a3e500e2`); permission ask ruled (Oak reads not
  granted; by-construction inference withdrawn, all 157 permalinks unverified, one owner card the
  Director raises); re-sized fleet approved (event 20:57:23Z); Juno's no-objection to this record
  and its continuity row (event 20:59:23Z); mechanical legs run (census, links, runner syntax,
  workbook, scanner reproduction and controls).
- **Recent relevant commits**: none on this branch yet; PR 66's head SHA:2db74f5bb (the
  author-lineage review published at 20:00Z on the owner's instruction), collection unchanged
  from SHA:5f04e4d0f; merge base SHA:6019dd44f.
- **Team expectation**: n=4 overnight (Director c5cc2c, Finch 47f9d2 on #58, Juno a693fb on #67
  and the consolidation drain, this seat); parallel-safe with every open claim; the lane PR takes
  the landing slot after #67.
- **Suggested team split**: none needed; a successor seat adopts claim `60d6d916` and reads the
  handoff record named on it.
- **Acceptance bar for the next agent**: the five acceptance criteria on the node; a fresh seat
  must not re-run the mechanical legs from memory — the report names every command.

## COMPACTION BOUNDARY 1 — 2026-09-06 ~21:1xZ (owner word: "prepare for compaction … then stop all processes")

Read this block first on resume; everything above it was true at pickup and is trued here.

- **Landed and visible**: the first-pass review on PR 66 —
  <https://github.com/EngraphCode/open-curriculum-ecosystem/pull/66#pullrequestreview-5126608127>
  (review 5126608127, `el-graphael[bot]`, COMMENT, 21:03:49Z, on head SHA:2db74f5bb). Eight
  typed findings; the R1–R7 mapping was promised as a second comment.
- **On disk, uncommitted, on the lane branch in the worktree** (never handover-committed; the
  lane PR is the landing): this record; the node
  `.agent/plans/delivery/public-service-ai-tuition-review.plan.md`; the report
  `.agent/reports/public-service-ai-tuition/pr-66-independent-review-2026-09-06.md` with its
  R1–R7 mapping, frame set and epistemic profile sections marked PENDING; the continuity row in
  `repo-continuity.md`; the pointing row in `.agent/reports/README.md`. `git status --short` in
  the worktree lists exactly these five paths.
- **Fleet state**: the frame gate and R1–R7 audit ran as workflow `wf_b8818d51-f17` (task
  `wbkvf07df`); its state at the freeze is recorded on the handoff record named on claim
  `60d6d916` (either absorbed into the report, or stopped with `resumeFromRunId` for a warm
  resume — the record says which).
- **Not done**: the mapping comment on PR 66; the frame set and epistemic profile in the report;
  the seat-inline checks not yet in the report's tip table (canonical-JSON, `lengthFrame`,
  graph-ingest attribution, `parseWithSchema`, cache single-flight, the lease, the
  publication semantics, the CLI backpressure — all hold at the tip by the zero-drift diff where
  the runner's own probes cover them, else unverified); the draft-audit leg and the critic; the
  full Cricket panel at the PR-open boundary; the lane PR (commit under the queue ceremony from
  the worktree with the bare `index/head` label and the worktree named in the intent; bot push
  with a 600 s timeout; draft PR at first push; sync once onto `engraph`; settle; bot merge — the
  Director's routing of 21:05Z gives this lane the landing slot while the other seats are paused);
  the non-terminal wrap after landing.
- **Owner packet** (recorded by the Director as one card for the morning, event chain
  7e41d68e → a3e500e2 → amended 20:56:49Z): the runner's cure and class ruling; the nine
  `oaknational` repositories' visibility (all 157 permalinks unverified by construction after
  the Director withdrew the by-construction inference on the fork's `parent: null` record); the
  settled-direction word.
- **Standing words absorbed this session**: permission requests route to the Director; standard
  tools over scripts; the deliverable on the PR comes before the ceremony around it.
- **Next safe step on resume**: re-arm the watcher first (from the primary, before entering the
  worktree) and assert it; gap-sweep comms from the freeze event's timestamp; refresh or re-open
  claim `60d6d916`; read the handoff record; resume the workflow by run id or absorb its result;
  finish the report's PENDING sections; post the mapping comment; Cricket panel; commit and open
  the lane PR; drive it to the slot.

## Landing target for the next session (PDR-026)

Target: `public-service-ai-tuition-review` — the report, this record, the node and the reports
index row landed on the lane PR; one typed review posted on PR 66; the owner packet on the
Director's record.

## Session shape and grounding order

Solo seat inside an n=4 overnight team. Ground in this order: this record's Current Continuation;
the node; the machine-local plan if the same seat; the claim row and the comms stream since the
last event this record names; PR 66's live head (re-fetch before any statement about it).

## Standing decisions carried forward

- The 17 imported files are never edited by this lane; findings route to the author's source.
- No Oak-surface read without the owner's word; the nine repositories' visibility is an owner
  fact and stays unverified by construction until then.
- Superseded 2026-09-07 12:4xZ by the owner's word ("I never wanted the review in a separate PR …
  you should have added your work to 66 in the first place"): this lane's records land on PR 66's
  branch, pushed by this seat as the bot. Until then the rule was: the seat does not push to PR
  66's branch and does not shepherd it; the intake declaration and the merge of PR 66 remain the
  owner's. Original wording of the rest of this line kept for the record: the draft hold and the
  PDR-140 intake declaration are the owner's.
- Authority-class findings never enter a refute vote; they travel verbatim on the owner packet.
- Every SHA on this record and the node carries the `SHA:` prefix; the blocked hook literals are
  avoided by wording, never by exception.

## RESUME 1 — 2026-09-06 ~21:2xZ–21:5xZ (owner word: "carry on, review PR 66 and use /ultrareview on subsets of it")

Read after COMPACTION BOUNDARY 1; everything there stays true except where trued here.

- **PR 66 state**: ready for review since 21:10:21Z (the owner released the draft hold); Copilot
  review 21:03:05Z (one comment: link the dated review from `.agent/research/README.md:184`);
  Codex review 21:13:12Z (one P2 at the collection README:71: surface the errata from the entry
  point). Both converge on the index-row pointer, which is this lane's F8 home.
- **Posted this window**: the second review comment, 5126692305 (21:39:18Z, head SHA:2db74f5bb):
  the R1–R7 mapping (five accept, two partial, none refuted; R1 re-derived by the seat; R2 and R6
  narrower than published; R4's cure re-homed to the OCE-side record) and the retraction of the
  first comment's finding 2: the 31 "dead" references use the fork's former name, which GitHub
  redirects (`gh api repos/EngraphCode/oak-open-curriculum-ecosystem` → `full_name:
  EngraphCode/open-curriculum-ecosystem`); the same former name occurs about sixty times on
  `engraph` at the tip. Failure-mode event `ced01103` carries the diagnosis (liveness inferred
  from a name mismatch, never probed).
- **Ultrareview**: the owner's `/ultrareview` refused the whole PR (21 files, 16,235 lines) and
  the command is owner-triggered only. The seat prepared local fixture branches for
  `/code-review ultra` in the sibling worktree `pr66-ultra` (from `origin/engraph` at
  SHA:341477368, installed for the hooks). The repository's markdown-links validator refuses any
  subset of the prose: the fourteen markdown files are one link-closed component (relative-link
  census in the report's reproduction block), so an eight-file subset failed the pre-commit gate
  with 93 broken links and its intent was abandoned by the workflow. No hook bypass was proposed
  or requested (the rule forbids an agent from doing either). The only link-closed subset apart
  from the whole is the three assets plus `.gitleaks.toml`, the reports index row and the
  published review (about 900 lines): branch `review/pr66-ultra-assets-and-integration`, intent
  `5daadd2f`, committed under the queue ceremony from the fixtures worktree as SHA:580879aeb;
  never pushed; to be deleted only after harvest (at this block it exists and is untriggered).
  The prose chapters cannot be reviewed apart by any size-capped tool.
- **Report**: the PENDING sections are filled (mapping, frame set with adjudication of the four
  cards, epistemic profile and conflict ledger, spend rows: 1.04M measured for `wf_b8818d51-f17`,
  stopped with six of seven legs returned, R1 seat-inline, no resume). F2 re-trued as withdrawn;
  F9 added from the standpoint card (chapter 13 never links chapters 05 or 06, confirmed by the
  link census). Status: provisional. Packet item 5 added (the former-name sweep, outside the PR).
- **Liveness**: watcher re-armed from the primary (Monitor `bu8preeda`, asserted 21:2xZ) before
  any worktree entry; heartbeat loop `bgc0e5jt9`; claim `60d6d916` retained; window claim
  `59388d83` (git index/head) open for the fixture commits, TTL 3600 s from 21:30Z.
- **Next safe step at RESUME 1** (superseded by RESUME 2 below): hand the owner the fixture
  trigger; harvest any `/code-review ultra` return onto PR 66; commit the five lane files; bot
  push; draft PR.

## RESUME 2 — 2026-09-07 12:2xZ (owner word: "Director lands #58, Jackal finishes #68")

- **Overnight**: the lane PR opened as #68 (draft, 21:5xZ on the 6th, SHA:820c69030) and the seat's
  host was suspended from ~22:0xZ to 12:24Z; the watcher hit its hourly backstop at ~22:2xZ and was
  re-armed on resume (Monitor `bs3x0q39h`, asserted); the Director's ping of 22:47Z (event
  `52c3a92e`) is acked at this boundary. The estate rotated at 01:31Z: `coordination/2026-09-06-f1a142`
  folded to `engraph` as SHA:dfe924927 (PR #69; this seat's napkin blocks rode the fold), successor
  `coordination/2026-09-07-dfe924`.
- **Cricket at the PR-open boundary**: four roles launched with one frame (normal stance) at
  ~21:5xZ; no return before the suspension and no transcript on disk; recorded UNDELIVERED × 4,
  the seats stopped at 12:2xZ; no substitute run (the owner's word finishes #68).
- **Owner rulings** (~12:24Z, relayed by the Director: stream `4c19ff3c`, directed `e067247a`):
  #68 is this seat's to finish (sync onto engraph, five Codex threads, land after #58); the runner
  follows the standing policy (this lane's follow-on after PR 66 lands; no exemption class); all
  nine `oaknational` repositories are PUBLIC (Director's table, PR 66 comment 5570600664); the
  settled-direction word is still unanswered. The freeze block's loss scan is re-labelled
  recoverable-operational at the primary (Director residue from #69 round four).
- **This window**: sync merge of `origin/engraph` into the lane (clean, no conflicts; the diff is
  the five paths again); F1 and F3 re-trued to the rulings; the first node gate removed; the five
  Codex threads dispositioned on the node's review-dispositions table and answered on the PR;
  push; settle; bot merge after #58.
- **The ultrareview fixture** (`pr66-ultra`, SHA:580879aeb, 907 lines) still exists, untriggered;
  the owner triggers it from a session resident in that worktree, or it is removed at the lane's
  wrap without a trigger.
- **Next safe step at RESUME 2** (superseded by RESUME 3): land #68 after #58; the runner
  follow-on; retire this record.

## RESUME 3 — 2026-09-07 12:4xZ–13:xxZ (owner words: the record belongs in PR 66; questions go to the Director after the lenses, never in prose)

- **The record is in PR 66.** The owner had retargeted #68 onto PR 66's branch (08:15Z) and said
  "I never wanted the review in a separate PR … you should have added your work to 66 in the
  first place". The lane merged PR 66's branch (one conflict, the reports index row, both rows
  kept) and the post-#58 `engraph`, and pushed the head onto
  `docs/public-service-ai-tuition-2026-09-06` as the bot (SHA:a36471a7d); GitHub marked #68
  MERGED at 12:39:35Z; the five Codex threads on #68 are answered by signed reply.
- **Questions route to the Director after the decision lenses, and never sit in prose** (owner
  words 13:0xZ). Two asks this seat had left in prose were resolved at the seat under the
  lenses: the ultrareview fixture (worktree and branch removed; the subset was already reviewed
  three times over and the prose cannot be split) and the runner cure's route (into PR 66).
- **Runner cure applied in PR 66** (reduction to data): the listing
  `assets/oce-core-graphs-atoms-probes-2026-09-06.md` whose fenced text hashes to the imported
  blob `795808186a…`; the executable removed; README assets row and chapter 08 §7 link
  retargeted; `AUTHORITY.md` beside the collection (what placement confers; the three rulings;
  the deltas table); the research index row links `AUTHORITY.md` and both dated reviews, which
  answers Copilot's and Codex's index-row comments on PR 66.
- **Cricket**: UNDELIVERED × 4 at the PR-open boundary (recorded on the node); no substitute.
- **Next safe step**: PR 66's landing is the owner's; this seat answers review rounds on its own
  files in PR 66 (Copilot 3945259039 and Codex 3945282446 replied with the index-row cure), then
  retires this record with its banner when PR 66 merges.

## RESUME 4 — 2026-09-07 13:1xZ–13:5xZ (Cricket weaves Burrow, f8f302; owner word: a fresh seat "to actually review PR 66")

Read after RESUME 3. The first seat retired at the owner's word ("Your one job was to review PR
66, have you done that?"); this seat took its brief
(`handoffs/3484b6-jackal-wakes-nocturne-pr66-substance-review-brief-2026-09-07.md`) and opened
claim `f08ac8d9` (implementer; reports/, `AUTHORITY.md`, the node, this record's resume block).

- **Delivered on PR 66** (head SHA:82bf00121 at the reviews; tip pin SHA:6e9d67216): review
  5132463698 (13:23Z, S1–S6) and review 5132534231 (13:31Z, S7–S10) — the substance review of
  the fourteen files: every brief item has a verdict or a declared "unverifiable"; fourteen further
  chapter 08 claims and P0.1–P0.9 hold at the tip; chapter 13 fits ratified structure; the
  settled rows are proposals (owner ruling 13:2xZ, PR 66 comment 5571197335, closing the packet's
  last item); one perishable statement superseded by #58 (EEF renderers); chapter 07 and the
  evidence chapters honestly bounded; 13 of 20 probed citations resolve, 7 refuse a scripted
  client; workbook 102 records, sample consistent. No question survived the lenses; no Director
  card from this seat.
- **On this branch, this push**: `AUTHORITY.md` (ruling re-trued; second-pass pointers: EEF
  renderers at the tip, ADR-227 over the publication rows, the strategy index over 08:168, the
  tip table pointer); the report's "Second pass" section; the node's dated note and the gate
  re-trued to its remaining half (a node and parent for the chapter-13 programme); this block;
  the reports index row's stale "draft hold remains" wording (Codex thread on
  `.agent/reports/README.md:44`). The imported files are unchanged beyond the deltas
  `AUTHORITY.md` tables.
- **Review threads answered on PR 66** (five open at 13:3xZ, all on the first seat's files):
  Copilot on the research index row and Codex on README:71 (cured at the index row 41 and
  `AUTHORITY.md`; README:71 stays byte-faithful); Codex on the runner listing (applied); Codex on
  the reports index row (cured here); Codex on the rerun command at 08:331 (the imported bytes
  stay; the deltas table and the listing's header explain the historical instruction).
- **Liveness this window**: watcher armed from the primary before any worktree entry (Monitor
  `bbsds8x7m`, asserted 13:14Z); heartbeat loop `bhjrmwsmm` on claim `f08ac8d9` (armed at the
  owner's opening word although n=2 exempts it); team-start `8aa0c39d`; Director pickup map
  `727d36e5`/`f2e913b1`, ACK sent; status events after each review.
- **Spend**: seat-inline, no fleet, no subagent; about 0.65M tokens at this block (session budget
  counter), of which about 0.62M to the second review's post.
- **Next safe step**: PR 66's landing and its PDR-140 intake declaration are the owner's; this
  seat answers any further review round on the lane's own files, then retires this record with
  its banner when PR 66 merges. The owner's remaining gate on the node (a plan node and parent for
  the chapter-13 programme) is the Director's to carry at the next action moment. The runner
  follow-on named at RESUME 2 is discharged (the listing landed in PR 66).
