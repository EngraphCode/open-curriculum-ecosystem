# Next-Session Record — `codex-dialogues`

Thread identity: **`codex-dialogues`** is Codex as an invocable second opinion. It rebinds the
Codex dialogues onto `codex exec` and `codex exec resume`, under the ratified node
`.agent/plans/delivery/the-codex-dialogues-exec-binding.plan.md` on `engraph`. It is distinct
from first-class Codex support in the Practice (a Codex seat as a team member), which is the
Director's track. The owner, 2026-09-24: the two use cases "are not necessarily the same thing".

Opened 2026-09-24 at the handover from Blazar lifts Corona to Swallow holds Drift. Before this
record, the lane's pickup was the napkin section "2026-09-24 wrap — the Codex dialogues lane".

## Current Continuation

- **Invocation pointer**: continue `codex-dialogues` from this record. Treat every live fact
  below as a hypothesis until `gh` and `git` confirm it.
- **Controlling plan**: the node above: its `## Todos` (slices 1b-ii, 1b-iv, 2 and 3) and its
  `## Review dispositions` ledger.
- **Completed**: slice 0, PR 184 (`507d13931`); slice 1a, PR 186 (`418671f16`); slice 1b-0,
  the node's threat model and slicing, PR 188 (`fcbaa9bf5`, merged 2026-09-24 13:22Z through the
  merge door); slice 1b-i, the gate, PR 189 (`a0a2fead4`, merged 2026-09-24 14:59:44Z through
  the merge door, merge-landed event `4b4a0cab`); slice 1b-iii, the rollout reader, PR 190
  (`45c838297`, merged 2026-09-24 about 17:14Z through the merge door, both legs SATISFIED on
  the synced head `17cd699a1`; 2 rounds, 0 settlement pushes); slice 1b-ii, the cleanup row,
  PR 196 (`1a4450a69`, merged 2026-09-25 about 11:14Z through the merge door, both legs SATISFIED
  on the synced head `1f1b2d4bb`; 1 round, 0 settlement pushes; merge-landed event `ae8a8c07`).
  The node's Todos on `engraph` mark 1b-0, 1b-i and 1b-iii landed; 1b-ii's own mark rides the
  next node edit.
- **RESUMED 14:37Z, 2026-09-25, after the owner's compaction** (claim `372ac08b` kept,
  watcher and heartbeat re-armed). While this seat was paused, the Director routed Titan turns
  Ether the daemon leg, the config split and the wake sink (c540e862, 12:49Z). On this seat's
  proposal `dbb83f6d`, the Director moved the lineage twin of JC.net PR 190 (the watcher polls
  on a plain timer; Siren's plan 09f9a852) to this seat (14:45:14Z). The twin unblocks every
  push from the primary, the fold (PR 187) included. Titan keeps PR 211, the config split and
  the sink; a Codex seat landing the sink is goal two's own evidence. This seat's pre-execution
  review of the sink resumes after the twin lands. The twin's claim is `d8773fd8`, in the
  worktree `oce-wt-watcher-twin` on `fix/comms-watch-poll-only-twin`. The Cricket clause
  landed as `f67bd1f06`; its exchange row went to JC.net as `bfc686cf` and landed there as
  JC.net PR 191 (`251cd984`).
- **PR 214, the watcher twin, LANDED** about 15:35Z as `0a816621e` (head `d07e33df5`; both legs
  SATISFIED; 1 round, 0 findings; branch, worktree and claim `d8773fd8` closed). The deletion
  sweep ran after the merge instead of before it (napkin, 15:38Z). Four reviews before opening
  (code, test, docs-adr, onboarding): none blocking. Their prose findings in shared text are one
  joint-cure row (`c17c34d7`), accepted by Siren (JC.net drafts it) and by Myrtle turns Canopy,
  this estate's exchange seat from 14:53Z (it takes the bytes after the twin lands). The fold
  (PR 187) was pushed at `bdb4b49c6`, and it carries this seat's four records commits.
- **The wake bridge's slice 2 gate fired (15:57Z), and the owner RELEASED it at about 17:2xZ**
  (verbatim "1. Approve", relayed by the Director as `281b584b`). code-expert's
  pre-execution review and a read of codex-cli 0.157.0 source found three things:
  - Codex deliberately denies every sandbox below full-disk write any file or Unix-socket access
    to the app-server daemon's socket directory (`/tmp/codex-daemon-<uid>`):
    `sandboxing/src/seatbelt.rs` about 1063-1068, and the vendor test
    `daemon_sockets_are_denied_despite_network_and_tmp_write_grants`.
  - `codex queue` refuses `--no-daemon`, and refuses an embedded server while a daemon runs.
  - So a watcher the seat starts from its own shell can never queue into its own thread. That is
    mechanism-breaking, and returns the node to the owner.

  Also from source, R2 is retired: a queued message carries text only, and the thread's own
  config runs the turn; so the sink's argv carries no config flags.
  - The Director absorbed it (15:58:13Z) and asked the owner, recommending this seat's cure: a
    wake companion started beside the TUI by the seat's launch command, outside the sandbox,
    bound to a seat-authored thread-id handshake file. Until the word, nothing is built.
  - The other design findings, curable in the slice, are in `dbb48c46`: structured-only
    eligibility plus a `comms direct` sender clause, a one-notice latch, the wake debt held
    apart from the seen cursor, and a capped backoff. They go into the node's dispositions.
- **RESUMED (about 19:17Z, 2026-09-26) at the owner's start-right word, after compaction 4.** Read
  live first: nothing had moved on the stream during the pause; the slot was free (Siren's release
  at 16:39Z named 257 next); PR 257 CLEAN at 4 files; PR 246 carried one new Copilot thread on its
  final tip (16:34Z). Re-armed in the boundary block's order (watcher, the 240 s heartbeat over the
  four claims, `assert-watcher-live` green), then the resume report (`f9a46728`). Every peer resumed
  within the same minutes: Myrtle took 257's door under this seat's standing consent (19:20:23Z);
  the Director resumed and posted check-in 29 (`218ac865`).
  - **PR 246 CLEAN at 19:24Z (20 files):** the round-three finding (an origin HEAD hand-written to
    point outside `refs/remotes/origin/` is not refused) accepted as a follow-up with a signed line
    (reply `4112482305`), the thread resolved, the body carrying round three; announced (`b3b74dee`).
    **Follow-up owed, the guard's next change:** fail closed when `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` names a
    ref without the `refs/remotes/origin/` prefix, with the smoke case; `push-target-branch.ts`
    already refuses the shape.
  - **The reader-update premise refuted, before any code.** Check-in 29 routed "the reviewed update
    of PR 244's reader for codex-cli 0.157.1's record types". The source says otherwise: the
    codex-rs diff rust-v0.157.0 to rust-v0.157.1 touches thirteen files, none under `protocol/` or
    `rollout/`; `rollout/src/policy.rs` is byte-identical; `response_item.function_call` is
    persisted by both. Phobos's rollout differed in KIND: a seat runs the function tools
    (`exec_command`, `apply_patch`), persisted as `function_call`, where the dialogue envelope runs
    code mode (`custom_tool_call` exec); and `readRollout` refuses any rollout not of exactly two
    turns, so no seat rollout can pass it whatever its record types. The item, re-scoped and on the
    stream (`73cb2a28`): a seat-rollout command-record reader, `codex-exec command-records`, over the
    harness's `CommandExecution` items across any turn count, flagging the forbidden shapes of
    `.codex/rules/seat-landing.rules`, record types counted not refused, malformed evidence failing
    closed; fixture from this seat's own sandboxed `codex exec` run on 0.157.1, redacted. Design in
    the scratchpad (`command-records-design.md`), under pre-execution review (code-expert,
    test-expert). Claim `f7d8f0de`; worktree `oce-wt-command-records` on
    `feat/codex-rollout-command-records` at `95518f880`. The dialogue reader is untouched.
  - **OWNER WORD 19:2xZ (relayed by the Director as `65181d0e`, verbatim in the event):** a WIP
    limit: one coordination PR per repo, and three other open PRs across both estates together (the
    number of implementer seats); the goal stays zero with value merging; external PRs count and the
    Director schedules them. Nine open, so no PR opens and no branch pushes without its PR; the
    reader item waits for a slot, prepared locally only ("WIP slot taken: N of 3" before opening,
    at the opener's own first-hand read of both estates). The 19:2xZ opening routings withdrawn.
    This seat's finishing order (the Director by s2s): 246's door at its size turn; the offer to
    Myrtle on 245 or 217 (answered on the stream 19:28Z, not needed); PR 250's cure.
  - **PR 250, the owner's draft, readied:** the Director's analysis (`6c3d7736`) named the cure
    read from run 36243467557: `pnpm skills:check` listed eight missing projections for the new
    `user-value` skill. In worktree `oce-wt-user-value` on `codex/user-value-across-levels`,
    `pnpm skills:generate` wrote exactly those eight (`.claude/skills/oak-user-value/`,
    `.agents/skills/oak-user-value/`) and moved no other projection; commit `52a377a25`
    (owner-authored, gates green in the hook), pushed through `merge-bot push`, ready-marked as the
    bot under the PR 224 precedent, both legs requested, a readied-by block appended to the
    owner's body. Door at its size turn (12 files). Reverse by the owner's word only.
  - **PR 257 retired on this side (19:4xZ):** merged `e80122437` through Myrtle's door at 19:39:28Z;
    claim `25181dfb` closed; worktree removed; local branch deleted (merged into origin/engraph); the
    remote branch read back as deleted (Myrtle's deletion); ledger row written (3 heads, 10.58/40
    within). Copilot's synced-head follow-up (stale tracking refs after a remote URL rewrite can
    enter the scoped exclusion) is this lane's. JC.net takes the code by the next carrier.
  - **OWNER WORD 19:3xZ (relayed as `1448df04`, item 9):** a PR from a non-executing host is team
    intake: checked out, gated on its head, its own completion list worked as the todo, evaluated as
    a peer's PR, cured within the round budget or Rejected with reasons, then legs, ready-mark and
    the door. PR 250 is of the class by its own body. This seat's routing widened to the whole item:
    the regeneration `52a377a25` pushed (hook gates green on the head, so the full local set ran);
    evaluation by docs-adr-expert (the skill against `skill-naming-and-description-quality`, the
    plan-skill and README edits for belonging, the three research notes' home, one story or not) and
    prose-expert (the skill and its references); no evals runner exists in the estate (the parallax
    skills carry the same fixture shapes unexecuted; the skill-evals pilot plan owns the runner), so
    the seven cases and ten triggers are recorded as fixtures, not as an executed evaluation.
  - **The command-records reader's evidence read first-hand (19:4xZ to 19:5xZ):** two sandboxed
    `codex exec` runs on 0.157.1, every process closed (`ps` read back), rollouts private, findings in
    the scratchpad's `command-records-evidence.md`: (1) default exec is code mode even with
    `--ignore-user-config` (`custom_tool_call` named `exec`), while a TUI seat produces
    `function_call`; (2) an executed command leaves a CommandExecution item whose `command` is the
    harness argv `["/bin/zsh","-lc","<cmd>"]`; (3) a command the exec policy REFUSED (`git push`
    under the seat rules, refused with the rule's own justification) leaves NO CommandExecution
    item, only the harness's `Rejected("<argv> rejected: <justification>")` message in the tool
    output; (4) a command the sandbox denied after spawning (`git add` under read-only `.git`, exit
    128) leaves no item and no harness marker. So the instrument reads three classes from harness
    records (executed, refused, unaccounted), never a clean zero from absence; design v2 in the
    scratchpad (`command-records-design-v2.md`) after test-expert's ten findings (REVISE: verify the
    argv type first, widen redaction, strict fails on an empty rollout, a selecting helper, the flag
    matrix, turn attribution, relations not strings, a fail-closed matrix, line numbers, the CLI
    cases as an integration test with a lifted helper). Upstream observation, one instance: a
    sandbox denial detected after the process exited emits no CommandExecution item on 0.157.1.
    The seat rules themselves held on the probe: the forbidden push was refused before any process
    spawned, condition 5's mechanism seen first-hand.
  - **PR 250 readied under the intake rule (19:5xZ to 20:2xZ).** Two reviews: docs-adr-expert REVISE
    (blocking: the pr-relationships note, a dated review of a superseded head, filed as research; a
    handoff section inside the method review; "Clef" named nineteen times on a public surface with two
    private documents cited by filename and no private-upstream citation; two stories, the skill and
    the framework proposal); prose-expert REVISE (blocking: two link vocabularies across two
    references; shoulds: use value defined three ways, user value never reconciled, guarantee and
    purpose undefined, the opening leading with theory, a passive description with no routing
    destinations, about forty lines of the canonical restated in the references). The Director's
    rulings: the private-upstream citation goes in and nothing of the owner's text is redacted (the
    name's standing is the owner's card line, default kept; 250's door does not open before that
    word); the pr-relationships note re-homes whole to `.agent/reports/user-value/` with an index row;
    the method review loses §Completion elsewhere and its baseline SHA; no split (the owner packaged
    both on purpose; a split opens a PR under the limit for no landing). Cure commit `f41ad8e78`
    (eighteen files, owner-authored, hook chains green; one link fixed for the moved note's depth
    after the validator refused the first attempt), pushed through `merge-bot push`; the draft marked
    ready as the bot under the PR 224 precedent; Copilot's leg requested, Codex's on the ready-mark;
    the owner's body carries an intake block. The evals fixtures are recorded as not run (no runner
    in the estate). Post-cure prose check REVISE on small residues (one old-vocabulary sentence, two
    tables both headed Kind, a semicolon chain, one row typed too narrowly), all applied before the
    commit. Settlement budget untouched. 250 now reads about twenty-one files, after 246 in the size
    order. Follow-ups named, no PR under the limit: the research index rows for the two notes are in;
    the plan skill's routing paragraph placement (nit); no `trigger-train.json` (nit).
  - **Lane state at 20:2xZ.** Open, this seat's: PR 246 (CLEAN, 20 files, its door at its size turn
    after 217 and 253, about 21:20Z by the Director's projection; findings on its final tip get signed
    lines only); PR 250 (readied, about 21 files, after 246; the door waits on the owner's Clef word).
    Prepared locally, no PR under the limit: the command-records reader (claim `f7d8f0de`, worktree
    `oce-wt-command-records`, design v3 under pre-execution review by code-expert and test-expert;
    the two fixtures projected with zero leaks; the consolidation validator for the rules' patterns
    named as its own lane). Returned to the goal-two ledger by the Director's suite 25: P1, a pure
    sync push requests no review, timing this seat's after 250's intake and a review-cost survey.
    Retired: PR 257 (this seat's post-landing duties done). The exec-policy rules held on a live
    probe (a forbidden push refused with the rule's justification before any process spawned).
  - **PR 250 returned to the owner (20:24:39Z):** the owner converted it to draft and pushed
    `9a7ffdbaa`; this seat's read of CLEAN was of `f41ad8e78` (its two commits: the eight
    projections, then the cure of eighteen files under the docs-adr and prose reviews and the
    Director's rulings). Correction posted (20:42Z); the Director ruled no seat touches it, then
    (20:44Z) made it a lane on the owner's Appendix E (four skills with evals as acceptance, draft
    until complete), routed to Myrtle after 245's door. Myrtle's shape (20:49Z, 20:50Z): the
    host's eval runner is `claude plugin eval` (claude 2.1.283), verified by a one-case probe;
    seven commits, evidence per skill. Worktree `oce-wt-user-value` stays as it is; nothing of
    this seat's is owed on 250. The Suite 26 tally (20:53Z) narrowed the PR 224 answer to 224
    alone: a cloud-authored PR maps to the 19:3xZ intake word only, and its ready-mark is the
    owner's or follows the owner's stated acceptance.
  - **The command-record reader, two commits local, no push (the WIP limit):** cycle 0
    `ff2f284aa` lifts the `codex-exec` CLI cases into `cli.integration.test.ts` with a shared
    `makeIo`; cycle 1 `fd3518646` adds `codex-exec command-records` (summary of turns, executed
    commands per turn, every record type counted, malformed evidence and invalid lines with
    physical line numbers; `--strict` exits 1; the fixture a redacted projection of this seat's own
    sandboxed 0.157.1 run, 36 records). Design v4 plus amendments in the scratchpad
    (`command-records-design-v4.md`, `-amendments.md`), binding for cycles 2 and 3: string carrier
    for the refusal fixture, anchor after the last `Script error:`, no `denied` class, the
    `shell_command` alias source-read, classes exclusive and ordered truncated → refused → wrapper,
    invariant `calls === accounted + refused + unaccounted`. The post-execution review of cycle 1
    (REVISE, seven shoulds) applied before the commit: `executed` excludes `status: declined` and
    `source: unified_exec_interaction`; Zod `{ error }` messages carry the reasons (Zod 4.4.3,
    `issues[0].message`); `readCommandItem` returns `Result`; `parseCommonFlags` shared by both
    subcommands; tests on `assert` from `node:assert/strict`, `it.each` object rows, numeric nonce.
    Knip refused three exported types used only in their file (the two unions inlined into
    `CommandRecord`; `TurnAccount` imported for the accounts annotation; the index exports the
    summary type only). The refusal fixture (`observed-seat-refusal-0-157-1.json`) is on disk,
    untracked, for cycle 3. Remaining for the PR: cycle 2 (shell segments, `flag-command` with the
    rules' patterns verbatim, flagged entries, allowlist redaction), cycle 3 (harness text, the
    call-id join on `TurnState`, refused and unaccounted accounts, shared `readPreamble`), each
    under post-execution review; ADR-180 §2 "one tested subcommand" goes stale at landing. The PR
    opens at a WIP slot only, after a first-hand count on both estates. The consolidation validator
    for the rules' patterns is a separate lane.
  - **PR 246's door (21:0xZ), at its turn after Siren's 253 (`3377a3b1c`, released 20:59Z):**
    slot taken (`78332e80`; the line said 3 files, the PR changes 20). Owner-authored sync merge
    of `origin/engraph` in `oce-wt-branch-guard`, no conflicts, head `0aa24d1d7`, gates green in
    the hooks; pushed; both legs re-requested on the synced head (Copilot as reviewer, `@codex
    review`). Sweep read whole on the synced head: 70 removed lines, every one replaced by the
    cure (the `main` literal in the guard and the hook comments, the rule text, the frictions row,
    the `hermeticEnv` moved to `hermetic-git-env.ts`, the `test:e2e` line re-added with the smoke).
    Both legs answered at 21:10Z with one finding read twice (Copilot thread `PRRT_…mUJtY`, Codex
    `…mUJ08`): `hermeticGitEnv` hands the smoke's children `PATH` `/usr/bin:/bin` while
    `resolveTrustedGit` also allows `/opt/homebrew/bin/git` and `/usr/local/bin/git`, so a host
    with no git under `/usr/bin` or `/bin` fails the smoke's pass cases closed on the guard's own
    line; where `/usr/bin/git` exists the resolver prefers it and one git runs (CI, this machine).
    Confirmed first-hand, accepted as a follow-up with signed lines (replies `4112813557`,
    `4112813612`), both threads resolved, the body carrying round 4. **Follow-up owed, joined with
    round 3's, one PR (the guard's next change):** the smoke `PATH` gains the resolved trusted
    git's directory with the injected platform's delimiter; the guard fails closed when
    `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` names a ref without the `refs/remotes/origin/` prefix, with the
    smoke case. Survey before landing: four heads 8.4 / 9.96 / 8.02 / 0, 17.98 / 40 within.
    Merged `b332041ba` at 21:23:06Z through merge-bot, both legs satisfied on the synced head, CI
    green; slot released (`ce286fb0`) with the count read at three (245, 250 the lane, 256) and the
    guard twin routed to Siren, received at 21:23:56Z as Siren took 256's slot. Remote branch
    deleted as the bot (read-back 404); worktree `oce-wt-branch-guard` and the local branch
    removed; claims `d66f85da`, `56e5f0c5`, `8af60aaa` closed. Ledger row written at the landing.
  - **Lane state at 21:2xZ.** Open, this seat's: none. The reader (claim `f7d8f0de`): cycle 1
    `fd3518646` and cycle 2 (uncommitted, 374 tests green, under post-execution code-expert and
    test-expert review) local in `oce-wt-command-records`; cycle 3 next; the PR opens at a WIP slot
    after a first-hand count on both estates (three held: 245, 250 the lane, 256 at Siren's door).
    PR 250 is Myrtle's lane. Follow-ups owed by this seat: the guard's next change (two items, one
    PR); the reader's consolidation validator lane; the P1 pure-sync item's timing (goal-two
    ledger); ADR-180 §2 "one tested subcommand" stale at the reader's landing. Retired: 246, 257.
- **COMPACTION BOUNDARY 4 (about 16:35Z, 2026-09-26), at the owner's word "prepare for compaction,
  and then stop all processes, allow subagents to finish and make their work safe, then stop them".**
  The five review agents of this segment had all returned their verdicts (nothing in flight) and are
  stopped; the watcher and the heartbeat stop after the boundary event. This seat holds no slot.
  Every claim below is read live before any act on resume.
  - **Open, this seat's, two pull requests; any live seat may run either door under ruling 3, with
    this seat's consent given here and on the stream for the owner-authored sync merge in its
    worktree.**
    - **PR 257** (the DEGRADED-scan cure; `fix/secret-scan-scopes-remote-url-destinations`, worktree
      `oce-wt-scan-scope`, 4 files, head `b93e59971`): CLEAN since 15:57Z (Codex clean, Copilot no
      thread, CI green, zero unresolved), BEHIND; next at the slot after Siren's 258 (held from
      16:17Z). Its door: one sync merge of origin/engraph in the worktree
      (`GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Jim Cresswell" GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="1314980+jimCresswell@users.noreply.github.com"
      git merge --no-edit origin/engraph`), one `merge-bot push --json` at a host read below two, both
      legs re-requested on the synced head, the sweep (read at 16:31Z: 64 removed lines, every one the
      old name-only scoping or a fixture it replaced), `merge-bot merge --pr 257 --expect
      copilot-pull-request-reviewer --expect chatgpt-codex-connector --json`, slot released, the
      remote branch deleted as the bot with read-back, the worktree removed, claim `25181dfb`
      closed, a ledger row from `review-cost survey`. Two settlement pushes used (`18df9cfc0`,
      `b93e59971`); findings on a synced head get signed lines only. JC.net takes the same code by
      the next carrier (Siren's lane).
    - **PR 246** (the branch guard; `fix/branch-guard-reads-default-branch`, worktree
      `oce-wt-branch-guard`, 20 files, final tip `2f3c8a4c2`): both settlement pushes spent
      (`75c655504`, `2f3c8a4c2`); at 16:33Z CI pending, both legs re-requested at 16:29Z, zero
      unresolved threads. Findings on this tip get signed lines only (body, blank line, then the last
      line `— Swallow holds Drift, an agent, through the repository's bot (516619)`; another seat
      signs as itself). Joins the ready list when CLEAN; its door as for 257; on landing, route the
      JC.net twin of the guard fix to Siren herds Rudder (this seat's promise to the Director,
      2026-09-25), deletions with read-back, claims `d66f85da`, `56e5f0c5`, `8af60aaa` closed, a
      ledger row.
  - **Landed this segment:** PR 255 by Phobos wakes Void (`af49326dd`, 15:38:20Z), condition 5's
    first clean landing; records `5883cc5c6` (16:02Z) and this commit. Deletions of check-in 28 done
    with read-back (`25ee2511`); left for the owner's hand, unmerged and unforced: the local
    `claude/objective-nightingale-b4ba25`, the local `docs/codex-queue-probe-2026-09-25`
    (`ae110f662`, the private capture, never pushed) and `docs/codex-queue-probe-metadata-01a0d9`
    (`0475a9148`, nothing wanted).
  - **Next code items, in order, unchanged:** the sync-lineage cure only when the survey shows
    sync-only tip moves costing rounds (`.agent/reports/agentic-engineering/2026-09-26-sync-lineage-binding-design.md`);
    the landing toolkit's first wrapper, `merge-bot commit`, to the reviewed design now conserved at
    `.agent/reports/agentic-engineering/2026-09-26-merge-bot-commit-wrapper-design.md` (it lived only
    in this seat's scratchpad until this boundary); then the sync wrapper, stage, worktree; wake 2b's
    three PRs, 2c, the bridge's todo 3, exec-binding B, C, D and slices 2 and 3, the credential
    narrowing (condition 7). The Director's check-in 28: these stay with this lane unless the owner
    starts a Codex seat with a longer brief (an owner-card question, blocking nothing).
  - **Owner-card lines:** the three local branches above; condition 5's second indicator (the
    rollout's command records read by PR 244's reader, no refused-by-doctrine flag) is INCONCLUSIVE:
    Phobos ran the reader over its own rollout after closing out (stream 16:36Z) and it fails closed
    on codex-cli 0.157.1 with an unknown record type, `response_item.function_call`, so no admissible
    summary exists; the raw rollout stays private. The reader's closed union of record types was
    captured on 0.157.0, so this is "evidence follows the runtime" in practice. **The next Codex-lane
    code item is therefore a reviewed reader update** (list the new record type; decide whether it
    is a command record or an observation; fixtures captured on 0.157.1 with the creator ids
    redacted), ahead of the commit wrapper; the indicator is re-read on the owner's next Codex seat
    after it lands.
  - **Parallax on this segment, questioned and recorded:** (1) the scan-side placement of the cure
    was reviewed against the push-side alternative and held (the push contract and `trustOrigin`'s
    fetch-URL read); its falsifier is a bot push whose origin fetches from another repository, which
    `trustOrigin` refuses before any push. (2) Proposing a split to the Codex partner at 14:49Z, four
    minutes before reading the Director's routing for the same seat, cost the partner a claim opened
    and closed within a minute; the owner had briefed both this seat and the Director. Read: when the
    owner pairs a seat, the first message to it carries state, and assignments come from the
    Director's routing or after asking (napkin). (3) A ruling acted on twenty-seven seconds after
    its withdrawal (napkin 14:5xZ). (4) A push gate started against a host read of two (napkin
    15:16Z; the push line is conditional since). (5) PR 246's cure went up before its turn under the
    Director's order (eligibility needs a pushed cure), at the cost of one review round the one-push
    plan would have saved; held.
  - **Re-arm on resume, verifying by id first:** the heartbeat loop over the scratchpad's
    `heartbeat-claims.txt` (four claims: `d66f85da`, `56e5f0c5`, `8af60aaa`, `25181dfb`),
    `heartbeat-label.txt` and `heartbeat-branch.txt` (`coordination/2026-09-26-b84321`); the comms
    watcher (`comms watch --platform claude --model claude-fable-5-1 --supervisor-pid <this session's
    pid>`); `comms assert-watcher-live`; then the live state of PRs 257 and 246 and the slot before
    any write, and a sweep of the stream between every read and the write that acts on it.
- **RESUMED (about 14:43Z, 2026-09-26) at the owner's start-right word, after compaction 3.** Read
  live first: nothing had moved on the stream or the open list during the pause (the other seats'
  pause events only). Then, in the boundary block's order: the gate notice (`0cba1754`), records
  `0598b952f` pushed from the primary through `merge-bot push` at 14:46Z (remote and local level),
  the watcher and the 240 s heartbeat over the three retained claims re-armed and asserted live.
  - **The owner's word at about 14:47Z: "Phobos wakes Void (01a0de) is your Codex partner."**
    Phobos is a Codex seat (GPT-5 tuple) in claimless standby (team start `7971fef0`, 14:44Z;
    bootstrap ready `14:50Z`). The pairing is on the stream as `f7e07e3c`; the dialogue lane is the
    ARC channel `.agent/collaboration/rapid-comms/2026-09-26-codex-dialogues-swallow-holds-drift-and-phobos-wakes-void.md`
    (a Codex seat has no s2s; each entry is nudged by a stream event). Proposed split, open for
    Phobos's answer: Phobos takes the DEGRADED-scan cure in `merge-bot push` as its one directed
    slice, landing through `merge-bot push` with no prompt, which is condition 5's live proof for
    PR 241's rules; this seat keeps the door work and runs the reviews Phobos's seat cannot.
  - **Team shape at 14:51Z:** Myrtle (resumed 14:49Z, drives 251 then 221 after its 245 and 217
    threads), Siren (resumed 14:51Z, live not paused, keeps 252 at its turn after 251), the
    Director (busy), Phobos (standby, paired with this seat). Door order by changed files: 251,
    252, 221, then 246 (this seat), 249, 217; 245 DIRTY; 250 the owner's draft. The slot
    coordination went to Myrtle by s2s (an offer to run 251's door with consent; default, Myrtle
    takes it). This seat's door is PR 246 only, after 221; its state read live at 14:52Z: head
    `aba19edb7`, BEHIND, CI green, the same three threads unresolved, both legs on that head.
  - **The DEGRADED-scan cure, this seat's, built 14:57Z to 15:15Z** in worktree `oce-wt-scan-scope`
    (branch `fix/secret-scan-scopes-remote-url-destinations` from engraph `43eb62a55`), claim
    `25181dfb` (its predecessor `744e4997` was closed by mistake on a ruling the Director had
    withdrawn twenty-seven seconds earlier; napkin 14:5xZ). Shape, from the pre-execution review
    (code-expert REVISE, three points folded): the cure lives in the scan, not the push.
    `configuredRemotes` carries each remote's FETCH URLs (`git remote get-url --all`); a destination
    URL scopes to every remote that fetches from the repository it names, by `parseGitRemoteUrl`
    (host, owner, name, case aside), the exclusion accumulating (`--not --remotes=a --remotes=b`);
    a path or unknown repository stays unscoped and warns. Post-execution: code-expert REVISE on
    three wording truths (folded), test-expert REVISE on one host-discriminating fixture (added);
    19 unit tests, prettier, eslint, tsc green. Phobos's P3 (PR 255, one file, head `58581b72c`)
    pushed through `merge-bot push` with no prompt at 15:0xZ: condition 5's first datum.
  - **Condition 5 closed by its first clean landing (15:38:20Z).** Phobos wakes Void (01a0de), a
    Codex seat under PR 241's rules, took PR 255 (the ADR-204 amendment, one file) from an
    isolated worktree through commit, `merge-bot push` (exit 0, pre-push gates green), a bot-opened
    PR, both legs, one sync push, a Codex finding disposed with evidence and a signed line, and
    `merge-bot merge` with both expected legs, to the merge `af49326dd`, the remote branch deleted
    and read back absent, with no owner prompt at any step (the Director's routing said STOP and
    post the prompt's text; none was posted). The parallax report's world-return contract asked for
    the rollout's command records read by PR 244's reader as the second indicator; that datum is
    asked of Phobos on the ARC channel. This seat's PR 257 (the DEGRADED-scan cure, 4 files, head
    `18df9cfc0`) is open with CI green and Copilot's round one (one finding, on the fetch-URL read).
    Phobos closed out at 15:41Z before the ask; the command-record datum waits for the owner's own
    Codex seat. The Director's check-in 28 (15:48Z): goal two's remaining Codex items stay with
    this lane unless the owner starts a Codex seat with a longer brief (an owner-card question).
  - **PR 257, round one (15:24Z to 15:50Z):** Codex clean; Copilot's one finding accepted (git
    fetches from the first `remote.<name>.url` only, so `get-url --all` over-matched); cured in
    `b93e59971` as settlement 1 of 2 (`ConfiguredRemote.fetchUrl: string | undefined`, read by
    `git remote get-url <name>`; one unit case for the unreadable branch; a focused code-expert pass
    APPROVED before the push); signed reply, thread resolved, body's dispositions, both legs
    re-requested at 15:51Z. Both of its pushes scanned without a DEGRADED line.
  - **PR 246, settlement 1 of 2 (15:55Z):** the cure `75c655504` pushed from `oce-wt-branch-guard`
    (the Director's order lists 246 as joining the ready list when its threads and the cure push
    settle, so the cure went up before the turn); the three replies posted with the signed line
    (`4111905017`, `4111905100`, `4111905172`), the three threads resolved, the description's
    round-one block, both legs re-requested at 15:59Z. The sync merge waits for its slot turn.
  - **Check-in 28 deletions, done 15:5xZ with read-back (`25ee2511`):** local merged
    `feat/codex-rollout-reader-verdict-inputs` (`-d`); remote `claude/objective-nightingale-b4ba25`
    (its one eight-line runner quoted in the event) and remote `docs/codex-queue-probe-2026-09-25`
    (0 beyond engraph) deleted as the bot. Left for the owner's hand, unmerged and unforced: the
    local `claude/objective-nightingale-b4ba25`, the local `docs/codex-queue-probe-2026-09-25`
    (`ae110f662`, the private capture) and `docs/codex-queue-probe-metadata-01a0d9` (`0475a9148`,
    assessed: Gale's ordering of §2.10 and §2.11 against the owner's resolution; nothing wanted).
  - **Door order at 15:58Z:** 221 (Myrtle, at the slot), then 217, 249, 253, 256; 258 and 257 join
    at the front when their legs settle; 246 when its legs settle.
  - **PR 246, round two and settlement 2 of 2 (16:01Z to 16:29Z):** Codex clean on `75c655504`;
    Copilot two findings on the smoke's Windows branch (the guard's backslash path handed to Git for
    Windows' `sh`; the shim embedding the real git's path), both accepted. Cure `2f3c8a4c2`: a shared
    `shellSafePath` beside `trustedShell` in `smoke-tests/trusted-shell-directories.ts`, separator-
    injected through `toGitPath` (identity on POSIX), used by the guard smoke, the git shim and the
    push-output smoke (the idiom's first, inline consumer). code-expert focused REVISE twice (POSIX
    identity; the mechanism is `sh`'s separator, not escaping), folded. Replies `4111994505`,
    `4111994578` signed, threads resolved, body round-two block, both legs re-requested. The budget
    is spent: findings on the final tip get signed lines only. `windows-basic` CI runs unit tests
    only, so the win32 smoke rests on reasoning and the resolver's unit tests.
  - **Records `5883cc5c6`** pushed 16:02Z (the resume, the pairing, 257, 246, condition 5, check-in
    28; two napkin sections; F-207's ninth; the ARC channel file).
  - **PR 257 read CLEAN at 16:16Z** on `b93e59971` (Codex clean 15:57Z, Copilot no thread 15:56Z,
    CI green); announced ready (`567b2722`); takes the slot at Siren's release of 258.
- **COMPACTION BOUNDARY 3 (about 13:15Z, 2026-09-26), at the owner's word "prepare for compaction, and
  then stop all processes".** The seat stopped its monitors, its heartbeat, the door poll and its idle
  review agents; nothing of this seat's runs. Every claim below is read live before any act on resume.
  - **Landed this segment:** PR 223, the fold, as `b8432103a` through Myrtle's door (this seat's cures
    `b8de68b16`); PR 248 as `2c75350a9` through this seat's door at 12:35:57Z (sync `6b638d7c5`);
    PR 224, the owner's draft, as `43eb62a55` at 13:08:50Z through this seat's door (synced
    `a04138374`; two Copilot vocabulary contradictions cured in `d30cfde33`, settlement push 1; the
    second round's two findings disposed with signed lines: the owner's private provenance and the
    plan's proposed validator names, both owner-card lines).
  - **Open, this seat's: PR 246** (13 files; the round-one cure `75c655504` committed in worktree
    `oce-wt-branch-guard`, UNPUSHED). The cure: the guard's own refusal when `git branch
    --show-current` fails; `resolveTrustedShell` (a Result over a fixed allowlist, six unit tests)
    and `trustedShell()` beside `trustedShellPath()`; the shim `git-without-show-current.ts`; the
    smoke under plain `sh`; two smokes' comments made true. code-expert APPROVED after the S4036
    fix, test-expert APPROVED. Its turn is after PR 221 (Myrtle) in the size order: one sync merge
    of the default branch in the worktree, then ONE `merge-bot push` carrying cure and sync, then the
    description's round-one block (three findings and the cure; the draft is re-derivable from the
    commit message and the three threads `PRRT_kwDORdPTys6mQPNJ`, `…6mQPyD`, `…6mQPyF`), three
    replies ending with the signed line, resolve, both legs re-requested, the door. Claims retained
    for it: `d66f85da`, `56e5f0c5`, `8af60aaa`.
  - **Next code PRs, in the Director's order (12:55Z, and the s2s ruling after):** the DEGRADED-scan
    cure in `merge-bot push` (it pushes to a URL, so the pre-push secret scan loses its destination
    scope on every bot push; push to the configured remote by name, or pass the remote name to the
    scan's range computation; one test: a bot push against a configured remote yields a scoped scan
    and no DEGRADED line; JC.net takes the code by the next carrier); then the sync-lineage cure (P1)
    only when the survey shows sync-only tip moves costing rounds. Its revised design is
    `.agent/reports/agentic-engineering/2026-09-26-sync-lineage-binding-design.md`.
  - **Records this segment:** `93f1cd0f0` (the cures promised on PR 223, the fold, three napkin
    observations) and this commit (the ledger rows for 248 and 224, F-207's seventh instance, the
    design report). Owner-card lines routed through the Director: PR 224's provenance pointer; its
    proposed validator names; a Codex seat for condition 5 (the Director's queue).
  - **Deletions, read back on comms:** PR 248's worktree, remote and local branch (the local one from
    the 224 worktree after unsetting a stale upstream to PR 211's remote branch); the emfile worktree
    and branch; PR 224's worktree, local and remote branch. Remaining for the owner's hand:
    `docs/codex-queue-probe-2026-09-25` (`ae110f662`, never pushed) and
    `docs/codex-queue-probe-metadata-01a0d9` (`0475a9148`), forced deletes refused.
  - **Parallax on this segment, questioned and recorded:** (1) disposing three PR 244 stalenesses
    on the fold as "cured in the next commit" rather than pushing kept the fold's checks from
    restarting for six queued PRs, at the cost of three false lines merged for seventeen minutes; the
    cure landed at 12:26Z as promised; held. (2) Curing two lines of the owner's doctrine in PR 224
    at the Director's routing sat within the PR's own bar and is reversible, named in the reply and
    the description; the exposure is the owner's wording preference. (3) The sync-lineage cure was
    designed from a felt cost before the cost was measured; the pre-execution review measured one
    sync-only tip move in seven, and the Director narrowed ruling 7's premise. Read: measure the base
    rate before designing the cure. (4) Eight replies read as unsigned to the instrument (the survey
    prices 248's sync head at 33.43 partly for that); the signed line is corrected from 12:2xZ. (5) A
    chain left running through the morning's pause wrote to PR 223 a minute after the taker-over; this
    pause stops every process.
  - **Re-arm on resume, verifying by id first:** the heartbeat loop over the scratchpad's
    `heartbeat-claims.txt` (three claims), `heartbeat-label.txt` and `heartbeat-branch.txt`
    (`coordination/2026-09-26-b84321`); the comms watcher (`comms watch --platform claude --model
    claude-fable-5-1 --supervisor-pid <this session's pid>`); `comms assert-watcher-live`; then the
    live state of PRs 246 and 221 before any write.
- **RESUMED (about 11:27Z, 2026-09-26) at the owner's "carry on", after compaction 2.** Read live
  first: the fold chain had completed (sync merge `86fcf2d57` pushed; PR 223 ready, body and legs at
  11:24Z), and Myrtle turns Canopy had taken the fold's remainder at 11:25Z, so two hands wrote
  PR 223 one minute apart (napkin, 12:1xZ). Settled by s2s: Myrtle drives the door, the successor
  cut and the rotation; this seat disposes threads on its own files. Copilot's and Codex's legs
  returned eight threads over two heads, all on this seat's records: five stale facts cured in
  `b8de68b16` (PR 211 shown open, merged `fae981877` at 10:41:59Z; the owner's first batch thirteen
  PRs from 10:35Z to 10:50Z, not eleven to 10:48Z; condition 5 limited to commit and push, since
  PR 241's rules leave opening the pull request to the default flow); three PR 244 stalenesses (the
  ledger row, the next-order list twice) disposed as cured in this commit, with no second push on
  the fold. PR 223 merged as `b8432103a` at about 12:06Z through Myrtle's door; the successor is
  `coordination/2026-09-26-b84321`. Also this segment: the emfile worktree and branch removed with read-back
  (check-in 25, routing 2); PR 248's body reconciled to three citations and its thread resolved,
  then its slot at 12:07Z, one sync merge of `b8432103a` (one review-ledger row in conflict), pushed
  with both legs re-requested; PR 246's round one (Copilot and Codex P1: the guard's fail-closed
  claim leaned on husky's `sh -e`; Codex P2: the smoke's literal `/bin/sh`) cured in `75c655504` in
  its worktree, unpushed until its turn: the guard's own refusal, a trusted shell resolver
  (`resolveTrustedShell`, a Result over a fixed allowlist, six unit tests), the smoke under plain
  `sh` with a git that lacks `--show-current`; code-expert APPROVED after one fix (no `sh` by name,
  S4036), test-expert APPROVED. The Director's check-in 25 routes PR 224 (the owner's draft) to the
  first free seat after 248 and 221, this seat if 248 lands first. A design note for the
  sync-lineage cure (ruling 7) is drafted: a leg binds a head whose patch-id against the default
  branch equals the reviewed commit's.
- **COMPACTION BOUNDARY 2 (about 11:20Z, 2026-09-26), at the owner's word "fold the coordination
  branch, or let the Director do it, then prepare for compaction, and when it makes sense stop all
  processes".** The Director was compacted at 11:04Z and handed this seat the fold of PR 223 (the
  slot came free when PR 221 went BLOCKED on a windows-basic flake). This seat ran the fold's sync and
  records; Myrtle turns Canopy took the door at this seat's pause: PR 223 merged as `b8432103a`;
  the successor branch is `coordination/2026-09-26-b84321`, and this record continues on it. Every claim below is read live before any act on
  resume.
  - **Landed today:** PR 241 as `fc645531c` (this seat, the Director's ruling); PR 211 as
    `fae981877`, PR 244 as `4be54a077`, PR 247 and fourteen others by the owner's hand under the
    ruleset bypass (thirteen from 10:35Z to 10:50Z, four more from 11:13Z to 11:15Z).
  - **Open, this seat's, each with both legs requested on its head:** PR 248 (one file, the
    exec-binding node's two citations to research §2.11; branch `docs/codex-queue-probe-fix-pointers`
    in Gale's worktree `oce-wt-codex-queue-probe-01a0d8`, which stays until 248 lands); PR 246
    (ready; the four focused reviews' cures committed this hour: the guard header, the five hooks'
    headers, the rule's opening and Enforcement, F-190 partially-addressed, the current-branch read
    failing closed; worktree `oce-wt-branch-guard`; BEHIND after the owner's later landings, so its
    turn needs one sync). PR 244 was MERGED by the owner's hand as `4be54a077` at 11:14:18Z, before
    this seat's sync reached it; its claims `de2e9f7a` and `8d0c0bbe` are closed, its worktree and
    branches removed with read-back. The door order among ready PRs is changed-file count
    ascending; the owner lands small green PRs by hand when it suits ("don't block small green PRs
    on manual, but do maintain a list", 11:00Z, relayed).
  - **Claims at the boundary:** closed, since their PRs merged: `5e6dd23e`, `8a0f204e` (241),
    `278e98ea` (247), `56f6f270` (211). Retained, one set per open PR: `d66f85da`, `56e5f0c5`,
    `8af60aaa` (246); `3c3dd2e3` (248). Closed with 244's merge: `de2e9f7a`, `8d0c0bbe`.
  - **Deletions (the owner's word, ruling 8, this seat's own, as the bot with read-back, 11:1xZ):**
    the six merged worktrees removed (`oce-wt-codex-thread-id`, `oce-wt-merge-bot-default`,
    `oce-wt-codex-wake-sink`, `oce-wt-codex-dialogue-probe`, `oce-wt-codex-wake-queue`,
    `oce-wt-codex-seat-rules`), their six remote branches deleted (HTTP 204 each, read back
    absent), their local branches deleted by merge check. REFUSED by the harness's permission gate,
    not retried: the forced deletes of the capture branch `docs/codex-queue-probe-2026-09-25`
    (`ae110f662`, never to leave the machine) and of this seat's redundant sync branch
    `docs/codex-queue-probe-metadata-01a0d9` (`0475a9148`). Both stay for the owner's hand.
  - **Records:** `59b6d95d6` (the resumption); the Parallax audit at
    `.agent/reports/agentic-engineering/2026-09-26-codex-lane-parallax-audit.md`; the sweep event
    `5cd19684`; the 11:05Z napkin entry rode Myrtle's `fc8745e5a`; the formation letter's postscript.
  - **Next, in order (the Director's approved plan, 11:04Z; 244 landed by the owner's hand at 11:14Z
    and leaves this list):** 248 then 246 through the door at their size-order turns; the sync-lineage cure (ruling 7: a review leg binds through a pure sync lineage, so a
    sync re-requests nothing; a code PR on the merge bot's readiness reading); then wake 2b and 2c,
    todo 3, the exec-binding slices, and the landing toolkit (`merge-bot commit` first, to the
    design in the boundary block below; its first PR also tracks the 38 exec-policy cases and their
    runner, which today live only in PR 241's body). The JC.net twin of the guard fix goes through
    Siren herds Rudder once 246 lands. The fourth membership measure (cold Codex start to first
    landed PR) went to the Director for the wake-bridge node's owner.
  - **Re-arm on resume, verifying by id first:** the heartbeat loop over the scratchpad's
    `heartbeat-claims.txt` and `heartbeat-label.txt` (`comms send --tag heartbeat` with
    `--claim-id`, `--intent-id codex-peer-wake`, `--branch`, `--current-cycle-label`, `--platform
    claude --model claude-fable-5-1`, then `claims heartbeat` per claim, every 240 s); the comms
    watcher (`comms watch --platform claude --model claude-fable-5-1 --supervisor-pid <this
    session's Claude pid, read from the live shell> --step-timeout-ms 120000 --max-events-per-drain
    100 --exclude-tag heartbeat`, under `timeout 3600`). The identity tuple is
    claude / claude-fable-5-1 / 516619; a model switch needs `claims adopt` on every claim before
    the first comms write.
- **RESUMED (about 10:15Z, 2026-09-26) at the owner's team-start word, on claude-fable-5-1** (the
  owner's switch at the compaction; the eight claims were re-taken under the new tuple with
  `claims adopt`, since the comms route refused a mixed one). Monitors: watcher `bol8muoc2`,
  heartbeat `blzfdt3e7`. Every other seat was paused or ended at the read; the Director resumed at
  10:21Z (ruling `bce7a2ea`) and the exchange seat at 10:33Z.
  - **PR 241 MERGED as `fc645531c` at 10:32:37Z** under the Director's ruling: the six findings
    disposed under the ruled residual (one signed reply each, then resolved), the body's round
    three added with the codex-cli 0.157.1 transcript (38 of 38; the owner's Codex moved to
    0.157.1 overnight, and the re-run is the node's "evidence follows the runtime" in practice),
    no sync, both legs bound the tip. Acceptance test (condition 5): the owner's next Codex seat
    pushes through `merge-bot push` with no prompt; a failure is the landing toolkit's first cure.
    Follow-up, named by the Director: the landing toolkit, commit and sync wrappers first, then
    stage and worktree, each replacing its git allow.
  - **PR 211 custody is this seat's** (claim `56f6f270`; Gale turns Cloud ended at the owner's word,
    `ec940784`). Done: the Codex thread disposed (reply `4111105586`, cured in `00a23728b`, the
    capture cited by path, size and hash and kept local), and the conflict cured by THE OWNER at
    10:41:47Z through GitHub's branch update (`fb6f875f9`, committer GitHub): the queue-probe
    addendum stays §2.10 and PR 222's section becomes §2.11, the addendum's body verbatim. This
    seat's own sync merge `0475a9148` (the reverse numbering) in the worktree
    `oce-wt-codex-queue-probe-01a0d8` was refused as non-fast-forward and stays unpushed and
    redundant; the worktree is repointed at the remote tip only if a new commit is needed (the
    worktree took `CI=true pnpm install` after the version bump before its hook gates passed). The
    LOCAL branch `docs/codex-queue-probe-2026-09-25` still points at `ae110f662` and is never
    checked out or pushed. The owner merged it as `fae981877` at 10:41:59Z, twelve
    seconds after that branch update; this seat's body edit and leg requests of 10:46Z were moot.
    Custody closed; nothing further on PR 211.
  - **The Director's slot rule (10:21Z):** CLEAN takes the slot; a BLOCKED holder yields; no
    heartbeat for 20 minutes frees it; after 241, age order among CLEAN non-drafts (217 first, the
    exchange seat's), and the live seat at the door lands the next CLEAN PR whatever its lane.
  - **The owner's hand (10:35Z to 10:50Z), read from the merge metadata and the Director's relay:**
    the owner landed thirteen pull requests under the ruleset bypass (240, 211, 229, 235, 243, 247,
    226, 231, 236, 220, 232, 237 and 216, the last at 10:50:00Z), among them PR 211 (`fae981877`,
    10:41:59Z) and PR 247 (the wake companion's 2b design); four more followed from 11:13Z to
    11:15Z (234, 244, 238, 218). The Director's hold of 10:50Z
    (no push to any PR or to the coordination branch) lifted at 10:55Z on the owner's "I have
    finished landing PRs"; the owner's word of 11:00Z, as the Director relayed it: "don't block
    small green PRs on manual, but do maintain a list so that when I ask you can give me links".
    The new door order is changed-file count ascending among ready PRs: 221, 234, 224, 217, 244
    (14 files), 238, 218, 245; PR 246 goes when its reviews run or a posted review stands in lieu.
    The pointer fix `c7fdf7192` (the exec-binding node's two "§2.10" citations to §2.11, after the
    owner's resolution renumbered PR 222's section) opens as a one-file docs PR as the bot.
  - **Records of this resumption:** the records commit `59b6d95d6` (thread record, ledger, register,
    napkin); the Parallax audit of the lane's findings at
    `.agent/reports/agentic-engineering/2026-09-26-codex-lane-parallax-audit.md` (the landing model
    at core depth: the wrappers' warrant is the model's fluent reach for a flag under friction, not
    a boundary; the process and membership findings at screening depth, routed as evidence to the
    Director's suite and as a fourth membership measure to the wake-bridge node's owner); the
    knowledge-safety sweep event `5cd19684` on the stream, titled `KNOWLEDGE SAFETY SWEEP`.
  - **Approved deletions (the owner's word, relayed by the Director at 10:50Z and 11:0xZ), to run as
    the bot with read-back once the Director's plan event lands:** the six clean worktrees whose
    tips are ancestors of engraph (`oce-wt-codex-thread-id`, `oce-wt-merge-bot-default`,
    `oce-wt-codex-wake-sink`, `oce-wt-codex-dialogue-probe`, `oce-wt-codex-wake-queue`,
    `oce-wt-codex-seat-rules`), the merged local branches, and the private capture branch
    `docs/codex-queue-probe-2026-09-25` at `ae110f662`, now that PR 211 is merged. Gale's worktree
    `oce-wt-codex-queue-probe-01a0d8` stays until the pointer-fix PR lands.
  - **Next, in order:** PR 211's legs and door; PR 244 at its turn (sync if BEHIND, re-request
    Copilot, whose leg is on `62b2d41`; Codex is clean on `bf4ceb23e`); PR 246's four reviews when
    the weekly limit allows (it resets 2026-09-27 02:00 Europe/London), then ready and the door;
    PR 247 to ready; the landing toolkit; PR B; wake 2b; todo 3; condition 7; the JC.net twin of
    the guard fix through Siren herds Rudder once 246 lands; the merged worktrees retired after a
    content check.
- **COMPACTION BOUNDARY (about 10:00Z, 2026-09-26), at the owner's word "prepare for compaction
  … then stop all processes".** The seat stopped its monitors, heartbeat and subagents. Every
  claim is retained, since each backs an open pull request.
  - **Landed:** PR 239 (the merge-bot refusal) as `7bdb82059`; PR 233 (the thread id's owner in
    `core`) as `286440f78`. Both went through the door with both legs on the synced head, the
    sweep read first, and the slot released.
  - **PR 241, the Codex seat-landing rules** (claims `5e6dd23e` and `8a0f204e`, worktree
    `oce-wt-codex-seat-rules`, head `2458002cf`, synced, CI green). Both settlement pushes are
    spent. The synced head drew six findings, all open threads: fetch `--force
    --update-head-ok` rewriting a local ref (Codex P1), merge `--no-verify` (Codex P1), fetch
    `--upload-pack`, `worktree add` paths, `add -u`/`-p`, and a whole-index commit race. The
    slot was yielded at about 09:50Z. The Director's ruling is owed. This seat's verdict, after
    its reason pass: dispose of them under the ruled residual classes and land. The hooks
    residual already runs code the sandbox wrote, so the wrapper route buys guardrails, not a
    boundary. Condition 8 widens into a landing toolkit (commit and sync first, then stage and
    worktree), each wrapper replacing its git allow. The owner's live proof on a Codex seat is
    the acceptance test after landing.
  - **PR 244, B0** (claims `de2e9f7a` and `8d0c0bbe`, head `bf4ceb23e`, 14 files after a
    diff-cleaning sync). The code-expert's notes are cured in `62b2d4125`. Its legs were
    re-requested; read them on resume. Its slot turn comes after 226. The cross-vendor read is
    owed on the owner's Codex session.
  - **PR 246, the branch guard** (F-190's commit half, the Director's defect ruling; claims
    `d66f85da`, `56e5f0c5` and `8af60aaa`, worktree `oce-wt-branch-guard`, head `a69630320`,
    DRAFT). The code-expert's CHANGES REQUESTED are all taken, and the smoke kills nine mutants.
    Its four focused reviews (test, config, docs-adr, onboarding) died on the weekly usage limit,
    which resets 2026-09-27 02:00 Europe/London, and are owed. Myrtle turns Canopy agreed that
    this PR carries its own `turbo.json` input, with whichever of 246 and 243 lands second
    syncing the array.
  - **PR 247, draft:** the wake companion's 2b design (`f26615f55`, claim `278e98ea`). It was
    local-only until this wrap. It syncs before leaving draft.
  - **Gale turns Cloud resumed** at about 09:57Z (2026-09-26), pushed PR 211's metadata cure at
    `00a23728b` under the owner's direct approval, confirmed PR B and todo 3 as this seat's, and
    stood down for compaction with claim `be006748` held (handoff:
    `.agent/state/collaboration/handoffs/be006748-gale-approval-hold-2026-09-25.md`).
  - **Condition 8's design** (scratchpad, not tracked; this record carries its substance):
    `merge-bot commit --message-file <f> --author "<Name> <email>"` (author required and
    strict), with the message file checked before git runs, no `--json`, and no bot identity or
    mint. One scrub table clears `HUSKY`, `GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS`, `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` and the
    keys and values, used by commit and push. A real-git smoke is registered in `test:e2e`. The
    rules then allow only `merge-bot` verbs. The pre-execution review said GO WITH CHANGES; its
    changes are the ones above, and the Director accepted them.
  - **Next, in order:** the Director's ruling on 241's six, then its door; PR 244's slot turn;
    PR 246 to ready once its reviews run; the landing toolkit (condition 8, widened); PR B (its
    todo now carries three items routed from B0's code review); wake 2b in three PRs on
    PR 247's design; todo 3; the credential-narrowing PR (condition 7). Once PR 246 lands, route JC.net's twin of the guard fix through Siren herds Rudder, if its hook has the same shape (this seat's promise to the Director, 2026-09-25). Retire the merged
    worktrees (`oce-wt-codex-thread-id`, `oce-wt-merge-bot-default`, `oce-wt-codex-wake-sink`,
    `oce-wt-codex-dialogue-probe`) after a content check.
  - **Re-arm on resume, verifying by id first:** the heartbeat loop over the scratchpad's
    `heartbeat-claims.txt` and `heartbeat-label.txt`; the comms watcher (`comms watch
    --supervisor-pid <this session's> --exclude-tag heartbeat`); the Gale channel tail over
    `.agent/collaboration/rapid-comms/2026-09-25-codex-dialogues-gale-turns-cloud-and-swallow-holds-drift.md`.
- **Superseded, NOW (about 17:35Z, 2026-09-25): two lanes in parallel.**
  - **1b-iv PR A is PR 222.** It is on `feat/codex-dialogue-probe` in the worktree
    `oce-wt-codex-dialogue-probe`, head `c0ddb2188`, with five commits: the probe contract
    version (`1cc7649cb`); the seven-day age limit (`098360176`); the node's re-slice into four
    PRs (`635eacff5`); and the cures of four focused reviews, code (`aba24a08e`) then the node
    with research note §2.10 (`c0ddb2188`). Copilot and Codex are clean on the final head, and
    settlement push 1 of 2 is spent. The Director confirmed this seat's rule 10 tightening: a
    disabled name missing from `features list`, or listed `removed`, fails the probe. PR 222
    queues for the slot after PR 219, Myrtle's drafts and PR 211. Run the deletion sweep BEFORE
    the door.
  - **PR B is Gale's** (the reader's closed reasons, `turn_context.network`, a reused
    `call_id`). C follows B, and D follows A and C.
  - **The wake bridge's slice 2**, claim `278e98ea`, worktree `oce-wt-codex-wake-sink` on
    `feat/codex-wake-sink` from engraph `7497696fe`. Its node edit is uncommitted there:
    mechanism 1 to 8 rewritten to the companion, the acceptance criteria, todo 2 released, and
    the 2026-09-25 dispositions. Pre-execution code-expert and security-expert reviews are
    running. It edits none of the watcher files under Myrtle's claim `dc3bcace`.
- **Gale turns Cloud (01a0d9)** holds `be006748` at an approval hold (15:18Z): the PR 211
  metadata cure `00a23728b` (this seat's read: sound) waits on the owner's explicit approval in
  Gale's session, because Codex's automatic approval reviewer refused the push. The owner's
  approval was relayed by the Director (`281b584b`) and mirrored into the pairing channel
  (`6761dced7`); it reaches Gale at resume. Record:
  `.agent/state/collaboration/handoffs/be006748-gale-approval-hold-2026-09-25.md`.
- **OVERRULED BY THE OWNER at about 13:00Z, 2026-09-25**, verbatim: "ALL seats need to STOP
  stopping mid session because of some ambiguous and made up "rules" about context. ALL you
  have achieved is stopping. Prepare for compaction then stop". So this seat is PAUSED FOR
  COMPACTION, not handed over. After the compaction it RESUMES this lane in the same session,
  claim `372ac08b`, with the next steps below, and it never stops again on a context threshold.
  The owner's word went to all seats (comms `6292fda0`) and to the Director, for the doctrine
  amendment (PDR-063's triggers and the start-right-team retirement triggers).
- **Superseded: "HANDED OVER AT REST at 12:40Z, 2026-09-25, under PDR-063"** (context 51.3% at 12:27:33Z;
  the owner away, the Director routing; surfacing event `cc536fae`). Claim `372ac08b` carries
  the handover record (local state, attached to the claim), written for either this seat's
  resumed session or a successor. Its next steps:
  - the wake bridge's todo 2: a pre-execution code-expert review of the sink first. Its gate is
    the node's text, "if any finding breaks the mechanism", which is about the findings, not
    PR 211's merge. No finding breaks it. The daemon mode is a named gap.
  - the owed Cricket-clause edit;
  - this lane's call-inspection PR.

  The Codex config split is routed to Titan turns Ether as its item after PR 211. The cited
  source reading is in the pairing channel at 12:29Z. Check-in 11's Cricket suite: 8 ON-TRACK,
  0 DRIFTING; 7 frame verdicts, 1 missing.
- **Todo 1's daemon-mode run** (this seat, 12:24:40Z, at Titan's go, from a shell outside any
  Codex sandbox). A healthy managed daemon started, but the TUI exited within 25 s with no
  rollout and an uncaptured exit message. Stopped, with no retry. Cleanup verified.
- **NOW (2026-09-25, from about 11:14Z): the wake bridge's todo 1 is open.** The owner paired
  this seat with Titan turns Ether (01a0d8, Codex), Luna stirs Radiance's successor, at about
  10:45Z ("you are now partnering with Titan turns Ether (01a0d8)"). The pairing channel is
  `.agent/collaboration/rapid-comms/2026-09-25-codex-dialogues-swallow-holds-drift-and-titan-turns-ether.md`.
  The probe protocol agreed there:
  - Titan runs the TUI legs, driven through a terminal multiplexer, in the owner's Codex home. A
    fresh disposable home reports "Not logged in" on 0.157.0. The session gets a scratch cwd,
    read-only sandbox, approval `never`, `--no-daemon`, plugins off and the user MCP servers
    overridden off. Cleanup compares process sets taken before and after the run.
  - The tmux run is recorded as the TUI client only. The editor-terminal host stays unproven
    until the owner-held acceptance run.
  - The desktop legs need an owner step (the owner at the keyboard, or the owner's word for a
    computer-use seat), which this seat puts to the owner.
  - The findings are a dated addendum to the concept note, in a small PR of Titan's under
    Titan's claim, reviewed by this seat.
  - The Cricket-clause edit is still owed, and is not a gate. The call-inspection PR in this
    lane (the `dialogue-turn` and `run-turn` integration tests' remaining `.calls` assertion)
    comes after the owner's test-doctrine retirement lands.
  - **TUI legs run by Titan at about 11:26Z** (0.157.0, one run each, tmux, a disposable Codex
    home linked to the owner's login):
    - idle wake;
    - typed input first, then queued;
    - a queue during an active turn ran after the turn completed;
    - a queue to a killed TUI was accepted and ran only on an explicit resume.
    None breaks the mechanism. The desktop and editor-terminal hosts are unproven.
  - **The Director's check-in 10 (11:21Z), answered at about 11:36Z.** Cricket suite 10:
    7 ON-TRACK, 1 DRIFTING, 0 WRONG-PRIORITY, 0 UNDELIVERED. The frame verdicts: 5 sound and
    3 flagged, of which 2 were accepted and 1 rejected.
    - The DRIFTING (high, adversarial) was accepted: the order of the dialogues node's remainder
      (1b-iv, slice 2, slice 3 after the bridge's slice 2, the wake sink) was this seat's reading.
      **DECIDED by the Director at about 11:38Z under lens 5, no card**: the order stands.
      "the inflight work" was the three PRs now merged, and the strategic focus is membership.
      The owner can overturn it with a line; the Director stated the verdict to them.
    - Card A (the owner's, in the Director's report to them with the "not now" alternative) put
      the desktop legs to the owner: the owner at the keyboard, with Titan queuing;
      a computer-use seat not recommended. The desktop killed-session leg is left unrun,
      because Titan's own seat runs inside the desktop app.
    - **Card A CLOSED by the owner's word, about 11:40Z** (relayed by the Director), verbatim:
      "why do we need the ChatGPT desktop host? My interest is Codex CLI". Also, verbatim: "nope!
      They were both started via the terminal with `codex`". So todo 1 is scoped to the Codex
      CLI, and the desktop legs are not run. This seat's claim that Titan runs inside the desktop
      app was an inference from a process name, and it was wrong. First-hand parentage: the
      app-server (pid 35269) was spawned by a `codex` TUI (35243) under zsh in Cursor's terminal
      pty-host. The bridge node's todo 1 and its acceptance criterion are amended to the CLI,
      with a dated disposition. The exchange row to the second estate is owed; the exchange
      seat is unheld until Myrtle turns Canopy takes it. Titan was asked to repeat the
      idle-wake and active-turn legs in the mode seats run, the TUI with its managed
      app-server, because the first legs used `--no-daemon`.
    - A correction to the Director: the two watchers under supervisor pid 35269 are Titan's, not
      Luna's. The app-server started at 10:43:01Z, and the watchers at 10:47:01Z and 10:55:21Z,
      after Luna's 10:34Z closeout.
- **STRATEGIC FOCUS SWITCHED at the owner's word, about 15:27Z on 2026-09-24**, verbatim: "Finish
  the inflight work, but switch strategic focus to making Codex a first class peer in the
  Practice". The Director was told as the downward-direction rule requires. Consequences:
  - **In-flight, to finish to merged**: 1b-ii, PR 190 (1b-iii), and Luna's PR 193.
  - **Sequenced after the wake bridge's slice 2 lands**, by this seat's reading of the owner's
    focus switch (the sequencing is the seat's, not the owner's words), unless the owner
    re-sequences them:
    1b-iv, slice 2, slice 3 and the trial close-out.
  - **The new strategic work**: a worked Codex membership programme under
    `agent-platform-citizenship`. Its first step is the sketch
    `.agent/plans/delivery/codex-queue-wake-bridge.plan.md`, authored 2026-09-24 about 15:35Z,
    uncommitted on the coordination branch. It awaits the owner's ratification, and it
    supersedes the `codex-app-server-idle-wake` sketch on ratification. Its sibling nodes, not
    yet authored, are `PreToolUse` guard parity on Codex seats and the live acceptance seat.
  - **The co-owner: Luna stirs Radiance, CONFIRMED by the Director at about 15:35Z.** The Director
    first named Forge herds Vapor, but Forge stood down at 13:18Z (comms `ab6c44af`), and the
    Director accepted the correction. Forge's 10:39Z ask is named as the programme's origin, and
    Luna's seat runs the live acceptance journey. Co-ownership starts with Luna's review of the
    sketch; the questions for it are on the pairing channel at 15:35:43Z.
  - Citizenship text is shared Practice text, so its doctrine lands as the same bytes in both
    estates, carried by Siren herds Rudder as an exchange row once ratified (the Director).
- **Team expectation**: the lane owner is a Claude seat. A Codex seat takes code cures on
  1b-iii when one is live. Questions go to the Director (Wick binds Temper, `ed7b48`) with a
  lens verdict, question first. Do not update the Director except with a question or request.
- **Paused again at the owner's word about 15:36Z on 2026-09-24; resumed at the owner's "carry
  on" at 15:42Z** after compaction, re-armed in the recipe's order by 15:44Z. Since then:
  - The continuity commit `f45c8c7d1` and the sketch's own commit `7e9b2cf7f` landed on the
    coordination branch, pushed at 15:47Z.
  - 1b-ii steps 2 to 4 were committed (see its lane).
  - Luna stirs Radiance reviewed the wake sketch (the pairing channel, 15:54:00Z); all four points
    were accepted and folded in, uncommitted.
  - The host gate question was settled by the Director at about 16:00Z. The cure is
    `no-unbounded-host-load` item 6's semaphore, ruled by the owner on 2026-09-07. Corrected at
    about 16:47Z (the Director, from Siren's first-hand read): it is BUILT in jimcresswell.net by
    that morning's PR 162. It gives pre-push gate slots, host bound 2 and ceiling 3, one gate per
    worktree, and loopback slots the kernel releases on death, with tests. The pre-commit slot is
    PR D of the ratified node `commit-as-the-full-local-gate`. This estate carries none of it at
    `engraph` `07d80ec02`; it arrives through Siren herds Rudder's batch three. Nothing is owed
    from this seat on it.
  - The Director's check-in 8 (16:18Z) was answered at 16:21Z. Its Cricket suite: all eight
    delivered, seven ON-TRACK and one DRIFTING (medium, adversarial). That verdict was on the
    load-average sensor, which `no-unbounded-host-load` item 4 disowns on macOS. It was accepted
    and acted on: holds now read the husky gate count, CPU idle and memory pressure. The frame
    verdicts also accepted:
    - 1b-ii's draft PR needs no landing slot;
    - the Codex-specific gap count is 5, not 7;
    - frames cite quotes as `git show <sha>:<path>`.
  - **REOPENED at the owner's word at 18:36Z.** The owner's card via the Director, answered
    before 18:35Z (the card held the Director's turn from about 17:08Z), verbatim: "Swallow
    continues past the line", described as "Swallow lands PR 190 and PR 196 in this session and
    starts the bridge's first step with Luna, naming the reading at each step". The default below
    had already run; the owner's word overrides it. Claim `372ac08b` was still fresh. Reading:
    65.7% at 18:36:28Z ("mistake-prone" zone).
    - **PAUSED FOR COMPACTION at about 18:38Z**, at the owner's word relayed by the Director:
      "Tell everyone who is over the context limit to prepare for compaction, you all know the
      drill, you've seen it a hundred time". Nothing new started. The four monitors were
      stopped, this record committed, and heartbeat-end posted with claim `372ac08b` retained.
      After the compaction, the card word applies to the resumed session: PR 196 first (sync
      past `engraph` `7409e5100`, add "Landed as PR 190" to 1b-iii's todo, ready, both legs,
      door), then the bridge's todo 1 with Luna stirs Radiance, naming the reading at each step.
  - **HANDED OVER AT REST at about 17:27Z by the default below.** No owner word had arrived by the
    harvest. The seat's lane claim `372ac08b` carries the handover record. Heartbeat-end follows
    this commit.
  - **DECLARED HANDOVER DEFAULT (the Director, 17:08Z, under PDR-063)**: context was 54.6% at
    17:05:06Z. After PR 190 lands, if no owner word has reached this seat, it hands over AT
    REST, with PR 196 (1b-ii) in the successor's queue. The owner has the choice on a card
    beside Marten's successor. An owner word to continue overrides the default.
  - The second membership node, `codex-pretooluse-guard-parity`, is a sketch file in the
    primary checkout, uncommitted. It was read from 0.156.1 hook source: `ask` and a bare `allow`
    both fail open on Codex, so a Codex renderer is required.
- **Paused at the owner's word about 14:33Z on 2026-09-24 ("prepare for compaction and stop all
  processes"); resumed at the owner's "carry on" about 14:45Z**, re-armed in the order below by
  14:48Z. Swallow holds Drift holds claims `372ac08b` and `2368c96b`; the pause record
  `.agent/state/collaboration/handoffs/516619-swallow-holds-drift-codex-dialogues-pause-2026-09-24.md`
  stays attached until the claims close. **The re-arm recipe for any later pause or compaction**
  (no compaction leaves a process alive; verify by id first, the task list and the process
  table):
  1. The all-channels watcher, as a Monitor with `persistent` intent, re-armed on expiry. Its
     command, with the session's own pid read from `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`:
     `cd <primary checkout> || exit 1` then `/opt/homebrew/bin/timeout 3600 pnpm
     agent-tools:collaboration-state -- comms watch --platform claude --model claude-opus-5-5
     --supervisor-pid <pid> --step-timeout-ms 120000 --max-events-per-drain 100 --exclude-tag
     heartbeat`. Then `comms assert-watcher-live`, and one foreground sweep of the stream since
     14:33Z.
  2. The peer-liveness delta poll (the recipe in `liveness-heartbeat-cron`, 300-second
     cadence). It pairs with the heartbeat exclusion.
  3. The heartbeat loop: a shell function `cs() { node agent-tools/dist/src/bin/agent-tools.js
     collaboration-state -- "$@"; }`. Never hold the CLI in a variable: zsh does not word-split
     it. Each 240-second tick runs `comms send --tag heartbeat --title ... --claim-id
     372ac08b-49d2-4322-a535-56044bf2a119 --intent-id slice-1b --branch ... --current-cycle-label
     ...` and `claims heartbeat --active <path> --claim-id <id> --now "$NOW"`, the latter for
     BOTH claims (`372ac08b-49d2-4322-a535-56044bf2a119` and
     `2368c96b-fb3a-437d-a7e2-8052328bc644`). Read `heartbeat_at` back afterwards.
  4. The pairing channel tail with Luna stirs Radiance:
     `.agent/collaboration/rapid-comms/2026-09-24-codex-dialogues-swallow-holds-drift-and-luna-stirs-radiance.md`,
     `tail -n 0 -F` piped through an awk filter that drops this seat's own entries.
  5. The Director's Cricket cadence: every registered role, normal then adversarial, one
     identical frame. The frame carries the todos as a quoted excerpt with file and commit, each
     owner word mapped to its todo, status and receiver (with event ids), ABSORBED and
     ROUTED-AWAY as two lists, the seat's own governing todo, a required FRAME VERDICT from every
     role, the "the rule behind every hold, the sensor that will see its release, and when that
     sensor was last read" table, and the authority for every NEXT item. Check-in 6 ran at
     resume (14:50Z to 14:59Z): six ON-TRACK and two DRIFTING (procedure-xhigh, both on the
     never-read door-classification sensor, already read at 14:52Z). The frame verdicts
     accepted: the owner's 14:29:27Z zero-open-PRs standing rule binds this seat too; owner words
     need event ids; a NEXT item without a cited authority reads as unowned.

## Lanes

### Lane: 1b-i, the gate — PR 189, LANDED 2026-09-24 14:59:44Z as `a0a2fead4`

- Merged through the door (`merge-bot merge --pr 189 --expect copilot-pull-request-reviewer
  --expect chatgpt-codex-connector`, exit 0, kind `merged`). Both legs were SATISFIED on the tip
  `4682907ad`: Copilot's review 5305937645 ("Findings: None") and Codex's completion comment at
  14:38:26Z. Rounds: 3; settlement pushes used: 1 of 2 (the `BINDING_FIELDS` cure). Merge-landed
  event `4b4a0cab`.
- The Codex connector's clean result arrives as an ISSUE COMMENT naming the reviewed commit, not
  a review object. The door classifies it: `agent-tools/src/pr-watch/completion-comments.ts`
  reads an unedited "**Reviewed commit:**" comment by an expected reviewer as a review bound to
  that commit, under the owner's 2026-09-16 comment-evidence ruling
  (`.agent/reports/merge-door-comment-evidence-decision-2026-09-16.md`). A refused comment (a
  quota notice, an edited summary) decides only while that reviewer's leg is OWED or timed out.
- The expected set: the "Copilot review for default branch" ruleset is disabled, so Copilot
  does not review on push; it reviews the first push and any tip the bot requests it on. A
  Copilot leg that was requested and answered on the tip goes in `--expect` beside the Codex
  connector.
- Cleanup done 15:01Z: the merge-base deletion sweep was read before the door (every deleted
  line a move or a reviewed cure); the remote branches `feat/codex-dialogue-gate` and
  `docs/codex-dialogue-probe-threat-model` were deleted as the bot; both worktrees and local
  branches removed after a content check (both tips ancestors of `origin/engraph`).

### Lane: 1b-iii, the rollout reader — PR 190, LANDED 2026-09-24 about 17:14Z as `45c838297`

- Cleanup done at 17:16Z: the remote branch was deleted as the bot, and Forge herds Vapor's
  temp worktree and the local branch were removed after a content check (tip `17cd699a1` is an
  ancestor of `engraph`). Claim `2368c96b` is closed. The post-merge harvest at 17:25:13Z was
  clear: no late reviews or comments, and 0 unresolved threads. `engraph` CI on `45c838297` was
  in progress then (CodeQL and Code Quality green); the successor reads its result. The history
  below is kept for the record.

- **Branch**: `feat/codex-dialogue-rollout-reader`, on origin at `5a0a8d189` (Luna stirs
  Radiance's cure, pushed by Luna through `merge-bot push` at the pause's delegation; verified by
  `git ls-remote` at 14:57Z). The worktree is Forge herds Vapor's temp worktree
  `oce-wt-codex-dialogue-rollout-01a0d2` (find it with `git worktree list`); its upstream is
  `origin/engraph`, so read ahead/behind against the named remote branch. If a reboot clears the
  temp directory, the branch ref and the commit survive in the primary checkout's `.git`.
- **State**: a draft. Forge herds Vapor implemented it (`29ecb5794`, `e78d4ca30`, `e1c310b71`),
  and Blazar lifts Corona synced it and opened the pull request under the custody in comms event
  `ce99302f`. The body declares a settlement budget of two. The lane owner updated the body at
  13:5xZ under the OWNER'S credential, not the bot's; that is recorded on the napkin.
  - A post-execution code-expert review ran at `59364d65d` and is recorded in the body. It found
    no correctness or safety defect. Its accepted findings were cured by Luna in `5a0a8d189`
    (eight paths, 17 tests, pre-commit 129/129 plus depcruise and knip):
    - the truncation test's runtime branch;
    - eight accepted-and-ignored record types pinned by redacted fixture skeletons;
    - TSDoc on the exports;
    - distinct mismatch kinds;
    - the `RecordedTurnContext` re-export, and helper names;
    - tests for `invalid-json`, `invalid-session-count`, a duplicate `turn_context`, and the
      thread-id mismatches.
  - `on-failure` stays rejected as a shape: in 0.156.1 `protocol.rs` it is only a
    deserialisation alias of `on-request`. The reason is now in TSDoc beside the schema.
  - Rule 10's source is routed to 1b-iv in the body.
- **The boundary with a successor Codex seat** (comms `dc7c5491`, written for Blazar lifts
  Corona, now the lane owner's): the lane owner holds every sync, push of a sync, the pull
  request, review requests, thread replies, dispositions and the door. The Codex seat takes code
  cures to `agent-tools/src/codex-exec/rollout/**` that accepted dispositions call for. It
  announces pickup before editing, works in its own worktree, and names each cure commit
  before pushing. When no Codex seat is live, the lane owner cures and records that in the body.
- **Re-reads of `5a0a8d189` (2026-09-24 ~15:05Z), both CHANGES REQUESTED**:
  - security-expert, which read the `rust-v0.156.1` tag:
    - BLOCKING: the truncation check misses Codex's own `... N bytes omitted ...` exec-output
      marker (the 1 MiB cap).
    - IMPORTANT: a late `session_meta` with no `thread_id` passes the thread-id check.
    - Suggestion: the `unknown` special-path kind.
    - Nit: the `on-failure` note should be TSDoc.
  - test-expert: 28 hand mutants, several surviving:
    - unknown nested types;
    - the permissive policy domain;
    - first-turn command output;
    - six ordering guards;
    - the preamble regex.
  - All are accepted, except two routed to 1b-iv, where the verdict consumes them: `network` in
    the turn context, and the reason strings as a closed union. The full list, with file:line
    and vendor-source lines, is on the pairing channel at 15:05:36Z, offered to Luna stirs
    Radiance under `dc7c5491`.
- **The cure commit is `5a695f0f2`** (Luna, named at 15:55:40Z, parent `5a0a8d189`). The lane
  owner verified it at about 16:00Z against all nine items, each with its test, from the shared
  object store. It is bot-authored with no body. Luna's first push failed on one flaky
  `agent-tools#test:e2e` task that passed on its own rerun; the retry follows PR 193's sync.
- **READY since 16:27:11Z.** The dispositions are recorded in the body (a bot write, about
  16:10Z). Copilot was requested automatically when the PR went ready (timeline, 16:27:13Z), so
  the explicit request returned HTTP 422. `@codex review` was posted as the bot at 16:27Z. Both
  legs bind `5a695f0f2`; all its checks are green.
- **Round one**: Copilot's review 16:31:03Z on `5a695f0f2`, "Approval recommended", with one
  Observation (thread `4095991046`, `response-reader.ts:64`). A `call_id` can be reused after
  `readCustomToolOutput` consumes it. Dispositioned as an observation, priced, with no change:
  no fixture or test exercises reuse, and whether codex-cli reuses a `call_id` across a
  rollout's turns is unrecorded. A whole-rollout seen-set would make a legitimate rollout
  inconclusive. ROUTED to slice 1b-iv, where the verdict consumes the reader, gated on a
  recorded rollout showing whether ids repeat. It is owed as a node ledger row at the next node
  edit; it went into PR #196's node row as `f06807bb9`. The bot replied (`4096113093`) and
  resolved the thread. The Codex connector's leg: "Didn't find any major issues" at 16:30:11Z,
  on `5a695f0f2`. Round one is clean on both legs. Rounds used: 1; settlement pushes used: 0 of
  2.
- **Slot order**: PR 193 merged at 16:25:00Z (`07d80ec02`). Marten took the slot for PR 194 at
  16:26:10Z, and this seat yielded, because PR 190 still needed its first review round. A local
  sync merge, `f2cd4797d` in the rollout worktree, is held unpushed; PR 194's landing makes it
  stale.
- **Next safe step**: on PR 194's merge-landed, merge `engraph` into the branch again, with the
  owner as author, and push once through `merge-bot push`, carrying any round-one cure in the
  same push. Re-request both legs on that tip; the door binds legs to the exact head
  (`pr-watch/reviewer-legs.ts` `bindsTip`). Then take the door with `--expect
  copilot-pull-request-reviewer --expect chatgpt-codex-connector`.
- **Do not publish** the original rollouts behind the fixtures; only redacted projections are
  committed. Forge's pickup index (comms broadcast, 13:34Z) names them for local
  re-verification.

### Lane: 1b-ii, the cleanup row — PR 196, LANDED 2026-09-25 about 11:14Z as `1a4450a69`

- **Landed**: synced once past `engraph` `f08201ab0` (merge `cd8466380`, owner-authored), then
  the node edit `1f1b2d4bb`, pushed through the bot, marked ready at 10:57Z. Both legs came back
  on that head by 11:00Z: Copilot recommended approval with no findings, and the Codex
  connector found no major issues. CI passed 21 of 21. The merge-base deletion sweep was read
  before the door. The remote branch was deleted as the bot, and the worktree and local branch
  were removed after a content check (the tip is an ancestor of `origin/engraph`). The history
  below is kept as the record.

- **Where**: worktree `oce-wt-codex-dialogue-cleanup-row` beside the primary checkout, branch
  `feat/codex-dialogue-cleanup-row`, off `engraph` at `a0a2fead4`. Built and installed. No PR yet;
  the draft PR opens with the first push, through `merge-bot push`. The branch is behind `engraph`
  (PRs 191 and 192 landed since); it syncs at its landing slot, after PR 190.
- **Step 1 committed**: `db726e641`, "a dialogue id is a bounded lowercase slug". It adds
  `cleanup-row.ts` (`DialogueId`, `parseDialogueId`) and 16 tests. Slip: it was committed without
  `--author`, so it is bot-authored. The rule calls that outcome fail-safe, and it is corrected
  forward: every later commit passes `--author="Jim Cresswell
  <1314980+jimCresswell@users.noreply.github.com>"`, the value read from `4682907ad`'s author.
- **Steps 2 to 4 committed, owner-authored**, each through the full pre-commit:
  - `10f77553c`: `threadsCreated(run)` and `CodexRun.killed.stdout`, plus killed-stays-killed.
  - `a34b104e6`: the rows on the turn path, including the refused-row failure. It was planned as a
    fourth step, and lands here because no commit may ignore the append's `Result`.
  - `6b5bd7955`: the node edit (the cleanup paragraph, exit 4, 1b-0 and 1b-i landed, the ledger
    row for the rejected resume request).
  - 198 codex-exec tests pass. The post-execution code-expert, test-expert (focused) and
    security-expert (focused) reviews were launched at about 16:05Z.
- **The design, settled by the pre-execution code-expert and test-expert (2026-09-24 ~15:15Z)**:
  - **The rule.** On OPEN only, every distinct thread id named by `thread.started` that parses as
    a `ThreadId` gets one row, whatever the verdict. `unlaunchable` writes none, and an invalid id
    writes none.
  - **Resume writes no row. REJECTED: both reviewers' "amend the node so `--dialogue-id` rides on
    resume".** Codex 0.156.1 source shows a UUID resume never creates a thread:
    `exec/src/lib.rs` `resolve_resume_thread_id` returns the UUID as given, and app-server
    `thread_processor.rs` `thread_resume_inner` errors when `read_stored_thread_for_resume` finds
    no thread. A stray thread on resume already fails as `thread-mismatch`, carrying the id. The
    node's CLI ("exactly one of `--dialogue-id` and `--thread`") stands. Name the limit in TSDoc.
  - **The request.** `TurnRequest` becomes open-carries-`dialogueId`, resume-carries-`thread`.
  - **Killed runs keep their output.** `CodexRun.killed` gains `stdout`: the partial output
    `spawnSync` returns on a timeout, a signal or an overflow. Add one verdict case: a killed run
    whose partial stream reads as a whole reply still fails as `killed`. Document that
    `unlaunchable` means no process started.
  - **Selection is pure.** A pure `threadsCreated(run)` lives in `cleanup-row.ts`, beside
    `DialogueId` and `CleanupRow = {dialogue_id, thread_id, created_at}`. `envelope.ts` stays
    unchanged; it is at 230 of its 250-line cap.
  - **The ports.** `now: () => Date` (the core calls `toISOString`) and `appendCleanupRow: (row)
    => Result<void, string>`. The test fake is an IN-MEMORY MAP, and tests assert its contents.
    The owner's 2026-09-24 test ruling bars call inspection: "never test config or implementation
    (no call inspection, no config pins)".
  - **A failed append.** Attempt every row. Then return `err({kind: 'cleanup-row-unwritten',
    threadIds: <only the unwritten, a non-empty tuple>, reason})`, superseding the verdict.
    Endorsed; losing one reply is cheap. The node's exit-4 list gains "a cleanup-map row that
    cannot be written".
- **The tests still to write** (test-expert's list): the success row's content; the verdict
  kinds `turn-failed`, `malformed-turn` (a stream ending before completion), `nonzero-exit`,
  `unexpected-item`, `unrecognised-output`, `no-agent-message`, and killed with timeout, overflow
  and signal; dedupe (the same id twice gives one row); a mixed valid and invalid id gives one
  row; two distinct ids give two rows; an append failure names only the unwritten ids. In
  `turn-verdict.unit.test.ts`: killed-stays-killed with a whole reply in stdout.
  `run-turn.integration.test.ts`: fixture updates only; the planned runTurn row tests are dropped
  as audit-shaped.
- **Commit order**:
  - step 2: `threadsCreated` plus `killed.stdout`;
  - step 3: the `executeTurn` wiring, the ports and the fixtures;
  - step 4: `cleanup-row-unwritten`, plus the node edit: 1b-0 and 1b-i marked landed, exit 4, a
    ledger row for the resume decision.

  Each commit is a test plus its code, one gate at a time on the host.
- **Reviews after execution**: code-expert (the node: before and after every PR), test-expert,
  focused (the node), and security-expert, focused, recommended by the pre-execution code-expert
  for the slug, the rows as future deletion input, and the fail-closed append.

### Lane: 1b-iv, the probe — not started (trigger: 1b-i, 1b-ii and 1b-iii landed)

- The node's Todos carry its shape. It also settles `apply_patch`'s availability by attempting a
  patch under the exact envelope.
- **Evidence ahead of pickup (2026-09-24 13:51:59Z, Swallow holds Drift, codex-cli 0.156.1, the
  latest release)**: one `codex exec` turn under the envelope's flags and settings with the
  owner's pins (`gpt-6-sol`, `xhigh`), an empty 0700 root and a fake `HOME`, asked for one
  `apply_patch` attempt. The rollout recorded a code-mode `exec` call running
  `tools.apply_patch(...)`, and its output "patch rejected: writing is blocked by read-only
  sandbox; rejected by user approval settings"; the sentinel stayed absent. So the patch tool
  IS offered to this model under the envelope, and its refusal comes from Codex's policy check
  in the tool router, a layer rule 9's `codex sandbox` leg does not exercise. 1b-iv therefore
  adds the second write leg the ledger's 2026-09-24 row names. **Caveat** (Luna stirs Radiance's
  challenge): `CODEX_HOME` was the owner's, not the instrument's own home, so 1b-iv re-runs the
  attempt under the exact envelope once slice 2 creates that home. The re-run is material, not a
  precaution: in `rust-v0.156.1`, `models-manager/src/manager.rs` builds its `FileModelsCache`
  from `codex_home.join(MODEL_CACHE_FILE)`, and `model-provider/src/provider.rs` passes
  `codex_home` to `OpenAiModelsManager::new` when no static catalogue is configured, so the model
  information that gates the patch handler's registration can differ by home (Luna stirs
  Radiance, 14:19Z). That the router refuses on policy before any write is an inference from its
  error text, not read in the router's source. The model's own tool list
  (corroboration only) also named `collaboration.spawn_agent`, `tools.request_plugin_install`,
  `tools.image_gen__imagegen` and the MCP resource tools; the rollout records no tool
  inventory. That bears on rule 10's source, which 1b-iii did not settle and PR 190 routes here.

## Owed

- **The stale-row supersession clause**: owed by the next edit to the node's ledger (the napkin,
  2026-09-24 midday section).
- **The rounds cap versus PDR-140 clause 4**: a doctrine candidate on the napkin. It is not this
  lane's to cure; route it through the Director.
- **The Cricket frame's sixth requirement**, accepted by the Director at about 14:40Z (seat
  wording under review, not a card, overturnable by the owner's word). The clause text is "the
  rule behind every hold, the sensor that will see its release, and when that sensor was last
  read". It goes into the Cricket skill's frame clause (`.agent/skills/cognition/cricket/
  SKILL-CANONICAL.md` §Build one identical frame) as this estate's copy, in a small lane of this
  seat's when the lane resumes. The bytes are the same in both estates, so it is also a goal-one
  exchange row, and Siren herds Rudder (158275) carries that row.
- **The continuity commit**, owed at resume. It lands `napkin.md` (entries from Blazar lifts
  Corona, Marten mends Shadow and this seat, all handed here), this record,
  `review-cost-ledger.md` (the 2026-09-24 rows for #189 and #190), the pairing channel file and
  this seat's formation letter, as a `chore(continuity)` commit on the coordination branch. It
  was not run at the pause, because the owner's word stopped every process.
- **The sketch's own commit**: `.agent/plans/delivery/codex-queue-wake-bridge.plan.md` lands as a
  `docs(practice)` commit on the coordination branch, separate from the continuity commit. It is
  an input to the owner's ratification, which it awaits; it does not become ratified by landing.
- **A host gate lock** (napkin, 15:36Z section): a clear process table is a moment, and this seat's
  pre-commit collided with a peer's pre-push. Route the proposal (a `host:gates` claim area or a
  lockfile the husky gates take) to the Director as a question.
- **The load gate is a workaround.** The pushes' "load below 12" gate (F-197) works around the
  `comms-watch-coordination-home` smoke test's fixed 10-second deadline, which fails under load
  (Blazar lifts Corona's napkin, three instances). This afternoon it held two pull requests'
  pushes for about 35 minutes and hid a defect. The structural cure is the smoke test waiting on
  the watcher's exit signal, already routed to an agent-tools owner. This seat's concept
  exploration asks for its priority to be raised.
- **Luna stirs Radiance's own lane** (Director-routed, not this lane's): the comms-watch `EMFILE`
  hot loop, on `fix/codex-comms-watch-emfile`. Its claim could not open, because F-95 refuses a
  claim without a live watcher and the Director's order forbids the spinning one. Two correct
  interlocks give a degraded seat no lawful claim path; Luna holds custody by comms instead.
- **The trial close-out**: the node owes a close-out of the trial threads in the owner's Codex
  home (the napkin, 2026-09-24 wrap section, "Trial close-out list"). Add the `apply_patch`
  trial's thread `01a0d3af-f4a8-7eb0-b33c-6e121b8c58c8` (2026-09-24 13:51:59Z) to that list.

## Standing constraints

- The owner's permission for Codex experiments (2026-09-23, 13:13Z): run the Codex CLI, close
  every Codex process you start when finished, and never start one with unlimited permissions.
  Always run the latest CLI and record the version tested; it was 0.156.1.
- The owner's goal, relayed by the Director: "bring the Engraph OCE Practice and JC.net Practice
  into alignment". This lane serves it as the invocable second opinion.
- The Director's cadence, at the owner's word (2026-09-24): every 45 minutes, a one-line status
  plus a full Cricket suite. The suite is four roles (cricket-judgement-high, -medium and -low,
  and cricket-procedure-xhigh), each run normal then adversarial on one six-field frame, with no
  model override. Send the Director only a DRIFTING or WRONG-PRIORITY verdict you do not accept,
  or a question.
- Pre-commit and pre-push gates test the working tree, not the index. Freeze a worktree while its
  gate runs.
- **Every third-party write goes out as the bot** (`bot-identity-on-third-party-systems`): pushes
  through `merge-bot push`, merges through `merge-bot merge`, and every `gh` write under a token
  minted with `merge-bot mint-token --scope pull-request-work`, assigned first and checked
  non-empty.
- **Rounds**: the owner's ruling of 2026-09-14 caps review at round two. A later finding gets a
  cure-or-Rejected disposition riding the settlement, never a further round.
- **The landing slot**: one pull request syncs and merges at a time across the estate's seats.
  Read the comms for the current holder before a sync or a door; a ready pull request gathers
  reviews while it waits.
