# .agent/ — The Practice Infrastructure

> **Human developers**: this directory is AI agent infrastructure. See
> [HUMANS.md](HUMANS.md) for where to go instead.

This directory holds the canonical infrastructure for the agentic engineering
practice that governs this repository. One Practice runs in two estates (this
repository and its sibling, OCE): its general layer is the same text in both,
and what binds to this repository is in §This host at the end of this file.

**Practice, not product.** Everything under `.agent/` is how this repository is
built and governed, never the product; §This host names where the product and
the Practice tooling live.

## Structural model

`.agent/` is the **canonical layer** in a three-layer architecture:

```text
                    .agent/
                    (canonical content — rules, skills, sub-agents)
                      ↑                        ↑
        referenced by |                        | pointed to, via
                      |                        | directives/AGENT.md
.claude/ .cursor/ .codex/ .agents/  CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md and the
and the other platform directories  other entry files the host's
the host renders                    platforms read or can use
(thin platform adapters —
 generated, one-line pointers)
```

Adapters and entry points are independent platform-facing surfaces: each
references `.agent/` directly, and no entry point consumes an adapter
directory. A rule in `.claude/rules/` or `.cursor/rules/` is a one-line pointer
back to the canonical version in `.agent/rules/`. Edit the canonical version;
adapters are regenerated with `pnpm portability:fix` (`pnpm skills:generate`
for a skill) and checked with `pnpm portability:check`, `pnpm subagents:check`
and `pnpm skills:check`. The platforms a host renders, and what each has
wired, are in
[`memory/executive/cross-platform-agent-surface-matrix.md`](memory/executive/cross-platform-agent-surface-matrix.md).

## How information flows

### Rules: directives → rules → platform adapters

`directives/` holds the authoritative source documents — principles, the
testing and validation strategies, the collaboration and continuity
directives, and the host's own. `rules/` atomises those directives into
individual canonical rules. Platform adapters point back to `rules/`.

### Plans: sketch → ratified → superseded / archived

Plans are plan nodes under `plans/` — `strategic/`, `delivery/`, `runbooks/` —
governed by [`plans/plan-node-schema.md`](plans/plan-node-schema.md). Every
plan is born `status: sketch` and governs no work until it carries an owner
ratification stamp. The pre-schema plans are conserved as records, each with
its disposition, where §This host says.

### Knowledge: napkin → distilled → pending-graduations → permanent homes

Session observations are captured in
[`memory/active/napkin.md`](memory/active/napkin.md). Distillation extracts
high-signal learnings into
[`memory/active/distilled.md`](memory/active/distilled.md). Learned doctrine
awaiting a home queues in
[`memory/operational/pending-graduations.md`](memory/operational/pending-graduations.md)
and graduates into rules, PDRs, ADRs, directives or documentation through the
consolidation workflow. Rotation of the napkin is an archive step that follows
processing; it is never a goal in itself.

## Directory map

The directories every estate carries. The ones only this repository carries
are in §This host.

## Entry point and reading order

Start with [directives/AGENT.md](directives/AGENT.md). The grounding sequence is:

1. [AGENT.md](directives/AGENT.md) — operational entry point
2. [principles.md](directives/principles.md) — authoritative rules
3. [testing-strategy.md](directives/testing-strategy.md) — TDD at all levels
4. [`memory/active/distilled.md`](memory/active/distilled.md) and
   [`memory/active/napkin.md`](memory/active/napkin.md) — learned context
5. [`memory/operational/repo-continuity.md`](memory/operational/repo-continuity.md)
   — where we are and what is next
6. The host's own directives for its product work (§This host)

For the full artefact index, see [practice-index.md](practice-index.md).

## This host

The facts above that bind to this repository (OCE); the sibling estate's copy
of this file carries its own section here, and everything above it is the same
text in both.

- **Product and tooling.** The product — the MCP server and the apps that
  serve the open curriculum — lives in [`apps/`](../apps/) and its
  documentation; none of `.agent/` is served to MCP clients, with one
  deliberate exception: the
  [`under-the-hood`](skills/orientation/under-the-hood/SKILL-CANONICAL.md)
  skill is the public orientation method the MCP server points integrators
  at. The Practice tooling lives in
  [`agent-tools/`](../agent-tools/README.md) and the shared packages under
  [`packages/`](../packages/).
- **Lineage.** The Practice originated here; its formal definition and
  conceptual boundary are
  [ADR-119](../docs/architecture/architectural-decisions/119-agentic-engineering-practice.md)
  and the three-layer model is
  [ADR-125](../docs/architecture/architectural-decisions/125-agent-artefact-portability.md).
  The sibling estate received the lineage by transplant on 2026-09-12.
- **Platforms rendered.** `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.codex/`, `.gemini/` and
  `.agents/`; the entry files are `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`,
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `skills.md`.
- **Host directives.** [schema-first-execution.md](directives/schema-first-execution.md)
  (types flow from the OpenAPI schema) and
  [editorial-tone.md](directives/editorial-tone.md) (the outward editorial
  voice); reading-order step 6 is `schema-first-execution.md`.
- **Pre-schema plans.** Conserved as records in `plans-backlog-2026-07/` (the
  lifecycle lanes and the roadmaps), `plans-old-archive/`,
  `plans-v0-sketch-2026-07-21/` and `plans-refounding/`; completed nodes are
  archived under `plans/archive/`.
- **Directories only this repository carries.**
