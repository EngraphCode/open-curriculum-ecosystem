# MCP-487 — string-encoded numbers at the MCP boundary

## Goal

A host whose MCP bridge sends numeric tool arguments as JSON strings (Claude Code did in August)
gets the same answer as a spec-compliant client: `"25"` and `25` both pass a `limit` bound of
300, `"5000"` and `5000` are both refused by it, and `"abc"`, `""`, `" "`, `"0x10"`,
`"Infinity"`, `null`, `true` and `[]` are all refused. The constraint is untouched; only the
representation is normalised. Owner ruling 2026-09-10: "487 sounds like it should merge, but
only with ironclad local proof that it does not break the relevant MCP operations."

## User groups and value

- **Teachers using an assistant on such a host**: keyword paging and the other six numeric
  parameters work instead of being refused before the bound.
- **The MCP surface's maintainers**: one generator rule, proven once, instead of per-tool
  workarounds.

## Mechanism

The sdk-codegen typegen wraps numeric parameters of flat MCP input schemas in a guarded
`z.preprocess` (plain-decimal strings only); six generated tool files regenerate from the
generator, never by hand; the content-audit surfaces re-attest through their own validator.
The August commit (SHA:9b6da6178, conserved as a patch) is applied onto the tip with the two
audit surfaces taken from the tip and regenerated, never hand-merged.

## Acceptance criteria (each with a proof)

1. The generator emits the guard for every numeric parameter and nothing else changes. Proof
   `repo-safe`: `build-zod-type.unit.test.ts` and `emit-input-schema.unit.test.ts`; the
   regenerated tool files equal the generator's output (`pnpm sdk-codegen` leaves a clean tree).
2. The nine representation cases behave as the goal states against the REAL generated schema.
   Proof `repo-safe`: a unit test importing the generated `get-keywords` schema and asserting all
   nine; cited in the pull request.
3. The served operations still work: every tool with a numeric parameter answers a call with
   the number as a string and as a number identically, and refuses the out-of-bound and
   non-decimal forms. Proof `repo-safe`: the MCP streamable-http workspace's tool-handler tests
   and the conformance suite green locally (`pnpm --filter <mcp workspace> test`, the
   `mcp-conformance` run), plus a recorded local call log of the six tools through the served
   endpoint with both encodings — the "ironclad local proof" the owner named, pasted into the
   pull request body.
4. The MCP content audit re-attests. Proof `repo-safe`: `validate-mcp-content-current-source`
   green after `refresh-mcp-content-current-source-anchors`, with the delta inventory
   regenerated.

## Out of scope

Any other coercion (booleans, arrays); the host's bridge; upstream's copy of the fix (the fork
never writes upstream; the finding rides the owner's held upstream-report item).

## Todos

1. Regenerate (`pnpm sdk-codegen`), diff against the patch's generated files, keep the
   generator's output.
2. Run the unit tests and add the nine-case test against the generated schema.
3. Run the served-operation proof and paste the log into the pull request.
4. Re-attest the content audit; commit; push; draft; code-expert and security-expert legs;
   Copilot; front door.

## Review dispositions

- 2026-09-10 — from the security-expert leg on #126 (adversarial, Opus): (F4, P3) the guard is generator-only, so the hand-authored numeric parameters of the aggregated `search` tools (`aggregated-search/flat-zod-schema.ts:54`, `aggregated-search/validation.ts:30,41`, `aggregated-user-search/validation.ts:30`) still refuse `from: "20"` — the bridge that motivated MCP-487 fails on the tool agents reach for first; follow-up: the same guard on the hand-written numeric params, one small PR. (F5, P3, pre-existing) `offset`/`limit` have no lower bound and accept non-integers on both encodings because the spec types them `number` with no `minimum`; cure in the generator from spec metadata if the API declares it, never in the representation guard — an upstream question, not this lane's. Routed here, not cured on #126.
- 2026-09-10 — from the code-expert leg on #126: (P2-2, with the security leg's F4) the shared `mcpNumber(inner)` helper exported from the tool-descriptor contract, emitted by the generator and applied to the nine hand-written `z.number().int()` params on five served tools — one follow-up PR; (P3-7) OpenAPI `integer` maps to `typePrimitive: 'number'` with no `.int()` emitted, so a decimal string now coerces where a JSON decimal already passed — emit `.int()` for `type: integer`; (P3-5) fifteen of twenty-seven files under the app's e2e-tests boot the app in-process, which the testing strategy classifies as integration — an estate-wide reclassification, not this lane's. Routed here.
- 2026-09-10 — from Copilot's round on #126 (8ea154cfa): a numeric enum parameter would reach `z.enum([1, 2, 3])` unguarded, so `"1"` from a string-encoding bridge is refused. First-hand: the spec declares zero numeric enums and the generated tools carry none; a numeric `z.enum` is itself invalid in Zod 4 (string members only). Follow-up when the spec first declares one: the guard before a literal union in the enum branch; replace the hypothetical fixture in `build-zod-type.unit.test.ts` ("does not wrap an enum base"). Routed here, replied and resolved on the PR.
