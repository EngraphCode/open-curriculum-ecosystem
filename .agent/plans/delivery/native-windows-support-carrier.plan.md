# Native Windows support — the carrier of upstream's changeset

## Goal

`engraph` runs natively on Windows for the agent-tools surface — path separators and drive
letters, trusted `git` and `gh` resolution, LF normalisation, pnpm resolution for spawned
processes, worktree matching under drive-letter casing — proven by a basic Windows CI leg, with
the work's authorship preserved and its two open security findings cured. Upstream set the
work down on 2026-09-10; the comparison record
`.agent/research/windows-changeset-comparison-2026-09-10.md` carries the analysis.

## User groups and value

- **A native-Windows contributor or agent host**: the estate's tooling works without WSL —
  offered value under the tier ruling's "goal", proven by the CI leg rather than assumed.
- **The owner**: the required Windows CI leg exists and reports the truth; the October
  merge-back carries a cured changeset instead of a rotted branch.
- **Upstream's author**: the work is not lost; the fork's copy carries the review closes.

## Mechanism

A feature lane off the tip merges the fetched head SHA:a57b89418 with `--no-ff` (four
conflicts: two test files reconciled by hand; two research-package files the fork deleted
stay deleted); two cure commits on the owner-only write (exclusive temp file plus rename;
the Windows ACL stance) with regression tests; one CI commit adding a `windows-basic` job
(checkout, pnpm, install, build, unit tests on `windows-latest`); the estate's legs
(code-expert, security-expert, test-expert) and Copilot; the front door.

## Acceptance criteria (each with a proof)

1. The merge carries every commit of upstream's head and nothing else. Proof `repo-safe`:
   `git merge-base --is-ancestor a57b89418 <merge>`; the merge's diff against the tip equals the
   branch's diff against the merge-base plus the four resolutions.
2. POSIX behaviour is unchanged. Proof `repo-safe`: the estate's full gate green on the lane
   (the pre-commit and pre-push gates; CI on the PR).
3. The symlink finding is cured. Proof `repo-safe`: a test plants a symlink at the destination
   and asserts the target is untouched and the destination is a fresh owner-only regular file.
4. The Windows ACL finding is cured. Proof `repo-safe`: on `win32` the write refuses before
   touching any file, with a typed error that both retention entry points carry in their failed
   outcome (no caller assertion can waive it); tests pin the refusal at the writer and at both
   entry points with the platform injected.
5. The Windows CI leg passes. Proof `repo-safe`: the `windows-basic` job is green on the PR's
   final tip; a red run leaves this criterion unmet and its failing tests name the next cures
   (the first run proved install and build on the Windows runner and failed eleven test
   expectations, cured on the lane).
6. #123 is closed as superseded, its disposition naming this lane. Proof `owner-held` (the
   platform's pull-request state is external): the Director closes it as the bot with a comment
   naming this lane; the owner verifies on #123; the closure is recorded on the
   estate-coordination thread record.

## Out of scope

Making the Windows leg a required check (owner-held); the WSL path (landed as #121); any
cure on upstream-authored lines beyond the two open findings; the merge-back itself.

## Todos

Owner decision 2026-09-11: `windows-basic` stays advisory for a week from its first green run
(2026-09-10) so flakiness on `windows-latest` is observed before it can block a landing; the
ruleset act follows on 2026-09-17 or later, at the owner's hand.

All of todos 1 to 4 are DONE; PR #129 landed at SHA:7ef047ae2 on 2026-09-10 with `windows-basic`
green on its landing tip, and #123 closed as superseded. Todo 5 is done as described below.

1. DONE — merge, resolve, gate, commit: the merge SHA:6d89538bf carries upstream's head with
   Luke Arnold's commits preserved and the owner as author of the merge.
2. DONE — the two security findings cured with tests: SHA:8eefe7045.
3. DONE — the `windows-basic` job: SHA:f3c0b3778; pushed as the bot; #123 closed as superseded.
4. DONE — legs and front door: the test and security legs posted on #129 (the code leg never
   delivered, the vendor's spend limit), Copilot on the final tip, landed by the front door.

5. DONE — verify the mode on the descriptor after `fchmod` (PR #131's successor lane, 2026-09-11).
   `OwnerOnlyWriteOps` gained `fstat`, the node adapter reads `fstatSync(fd).mode`, and a mode
   other than 0600 raises the typed `OwnerOnlyModeNotHeldError` BEFORE any content lands, so a
   mount where chmod silently no-ops (WSL DrvFS without `metadata`, exFAT, some SMB/NFS) refuses
   instead of retaining authenticated output world-readable.

   The test strategy this step's last clause anticipated resolved differently from the shape the
   succession record proposed, and the difference is worth recording. That record asked for
   `it.skipIf(process.platform === 'win32')` on the four real-adapter tests;
   `.agent/rules/no-conditional-tests.md` names `it.skipIf` first among its forbidden mechanisms
   and admits no local waiver, so the guard was not available. The rule's own third diagnosis
   gives the cure for a test that needs an absent environment resource: move the suite, never
   guard the test. The four tests that write through the real `node:fs` adapter now live in
   `agent-tools/e2e-tests/owner-only-write-posix.e2e.test.ts`, which `test:e2e` runs on Linux in
   CI, while the unit suite proves the ordering, the verification and both refusals through the
   recorded ops seam with no filesystem at all. The Windows leg runs `test`, whose registered set
   is now identical on every host — which is what the rule's dividing line asks for.

## Review dispositions

| Date | Source | Finding | Routing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-09-10 | PR #129, security-expert leg, should-fix | Verify the mode on the descriptor after `fchmod` (`fstat`), so a mount where chmod silently no-ops refuses instead of retaining authenticated output world-readable | Routed to this node as todo 5 at the owner's word to close the lane; the cure changes the Windows test strategy for the on-disk observable, so it lands as its own step |
