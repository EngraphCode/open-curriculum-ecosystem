# Use-value method: framing, review and handoff

## Purpose and landing decision

Help agents express, implement and assess use value at the levels relevant to
what they are building. The deliverable is the
[user-value skill](../skills/planning/user-value/SKILL-CANONICAL.md), its reference
views and evaluation cases, with a routing pointer from planning. This is
Practice authoring capability, not curriculum content or pedagogy.

Source baseline: Engraph OCE `engraph` at
`e6cf8ee4c9ac33d00884436e8d08767fc2b36c06`.

Existing planning already asks for users, value, mechanisms and proofs. The
missing method makes the relationships between purpose, needs, experience,
capabilities, contracts, implementation and evidence explicit. One focused
skill with optional reference views avoids one mandatory skill per noun.
No new rule, machine schema, validator or audience set is introduced.

## Correction that changed the model

The first draft was called `service-value`. The owner corrected the framing:
the subject is use value expressed and implemented at various levels, beyond
services. Metacognition identified an inherited service-design boundary from
the motivating case. A label-only rename would leave that defect in the method.

Concept exploration separated usefulness in context from representations of
it, concrete provision and evidence of effects. Reasoning distinguished
refinement, realisation, enablement and causal contribution. Proportionality
kept one method and optional views rather than expanding into a universal
ontology or implementation framework. The first broader name was `use-value`; the owner then selected `user-value`
for clarity. The scope remains use value expressed and implemented across levels.

The correction changes routing: an API or component with unresolved usefulness
is in scope; a settled algorithm implementation remains outside the definition
pass. A technical consumer can have a functional requirement without invented
human experience or a fabricated chain to national impact. Journeys and stories
remain useful when their questions apply, not compulsory at every level.

## Provisional framing record

Inquiry `USE-VALUE-2026-09-26`, revision 2; method pass `scope-correction`;
domain profiles: Practice authoring, service design and reusable software.
Source revision is pinned above; context is ChatGPT Work, text authoring and
static review only. Owner direction authorises a draft PR for completion
elsewhere, not local setup/build. Status: `provisional`.

| Basis | Unit, standpoint and question | Evidence and action | Blind spot and discriminator |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B1: experience | A person's situated activity; what becomes useful or burdensome? | Research and observation inform needs, journeys and changes | Can hide internal composition; discriminate by a usable interface whose outcome fails at a dependency |
| B2: capability and contract | A consumer-provider boundary; what may the consumer rely on? | Contracts, local verification and integration observations inform mechanisms | Can mistake correctness for usefulness; discriminate by conforming parts that consumers cannot use |
| B3: purpose and distribution | Affected people and consequences over time; whose ends are served and who bears costs? | Outcome, burden and authority evidence inform priorities and limits | Can become too abstract to direct a change; discriminate by whether it changes a concrete decision or test |

These frames are complementary, not independent empirical sources. Technical
size, organisational reach, population and time horizon are separate scale
dimensions. An implementation intervention may be local while consequences
arise later across several organisations.

Bridge BR1 runs from local contract conformance (B2, component boundary) to
usable workflow (B1, lived episode). The mechanism is composition with a
consumer under feasible obligations; uncertainty remains until integration
and use are observed. Information lost by local tests includes environment,
meaning and burden. A schema-valid yet unusable mapping defeats the inference.

Bridge BR2 runs from usable episode (B1) to wider outcome (B3, population and
longer horizon). It depends on reach, sustained use, context and alternatives;
there is no empirical evidence for it in this authoring exercise. Aggregation
loses variation and excludes non-users unless deliberately measured. Unequal
access or no subsequent benefit defeats a simple extrapolation.

Crosswalk CW1 translates a need into a proposed capability and contract
(B1 to B2). It preserves the selected purpose and conditions only partially;
it loses lived detail and does not uniquely determine a solution. The reverse
mapping is asymmetric: a correct contract cannot reconstruct the person's
need. Crosswalk CW2 maps a purpose into proposed needs and provisions (B3 to
B1/B2); it preserves direction, not evidence of demand or causal impact.
These are design hypotheses, valid only with their explicit contextual limits.

The serious counterframe is that formal traceability becomes bureaucracy.
Only retain distinctions that change a decision, test or handoff. Another is
that a demand-first method suppresses valuable innovation: offered value can
be an honest opportunity hypothesis. Neither counterframe justifies inventing
research or treating acceptance as demonstrated impact.

## Executed exercises and evidence limits

Two isolated fresh-context agents exercised the initial service-focused draft,
receiving its path and raw task without the assertion list or author diagnosis.
Both read its references and returned text. They share model/platform; this is
correlated review, not a controlled skill-versus-baseline trial.

| Case | Observed output | Limited verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Council evidence backlog; no research; staff retype uploads | Preserved A/B/C correspondence; separated features, needs and approval; exposed operational burden; named acceptance and dependencies | All six original case-1 assertions supported |
| Creative exploration; partner host; synthetic demonstration | Preserved offered value and unfinished questions; separated host responsibilities and delivery/experience/outcome evidence | All six original case-2 assertions supported |

Those results apply to the earlier draft. The broader `user-value` revision
received same-context conceptual and static review only. It has seven authored
cases and ten trigger examples, including two new cross-level cases; these
fixtures have not been executed against the revised skill. No effectiveness,
generalisation or production reliability claim follows from this work.

## Completion elsewhere

The owner explicitly requested opening the unfinished draft PR and will finish
execution elsewhere. This supersedes the earlier proposal to wait for local
generation permission. Do not run setup/build here or hand-write projections.

Canonical skill, three references, evaluation cases, planning/discovery links
and the Claude permission pair are prepared. Remaining work on an authorised
execution host:

1. Review the broader semantics, especially technical consumers and composition.
2. Run the standard `pnpm skills:generate` route, including required environment
   setup, and commit its generated adapters (including changed plan projections).
3. Exercise the revised skill, especially the new cross-level cases and routing.
4. Run the repository gates and inspect CI on the final head before merge.

Static content checks do not replace these steps. The draft is not installed
or merge-ready. No runtime or repository gate was run locally. The host lacks
`gitleaks`, so manual outgoing-content inspection precedes transfer and any CI
secret scan is the first automated scan after transfer.

Reopen if use fabricates evidence, confuses local acceptance with broader value,
forces one hierarchy onto all systems, erases affected people, or produces
records without improving a decision, test or handoff. The observed correction
is one reusable warning about service-first framing, not evidence of a general
failure rate in the existing Practice.
