# TypeScript graph foundations research

Research and recommendations completed on **7 September 2026**. The report
evaluates foundations by semantics, composability, assurance, TypeScript
usability and lifecycle cost. Its comparisons and executions are dated research
evidence.

For current development direction, start with the [governing policy](../../../docs/architecture/foundations/algorithms-and-data-structures-governance-2026-09-08.md)
and [foundations bundle index](../../../docs/architecture/foundations/foundations-bundle-index-2026-09-08.md).
OCE authors its graph and non-graph algorithms and data structures from SMALL
Reliable Atoms and meaningful compositions. This research supplies mechanisms,
contract distinctions and counterexamples that can inform those designs; the
governing policy owns implementation origin and reference use.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Report](typescript-graph-foundations-report-2026-09-07.md) | Definitions, competing architectures, library and model comparisons, executed findings, and proposed OCE outcomes. |
| [Reproduction guide](typescript-graph-foundations-reproduction-2026-09-07.md) | Environment, extraction, installation, execution and interpretation instructions. |
| [Probe source bundle](typescript-graph-foundations-probes-2026-09-07.json) | Eighteen UTF-8 source files with SHA-256 hashes, including pinned manifests and lockfiles. |
| [Recorded evidence](typescript-graph-foundations-evidence-2026-09-07.json) | Raw observations, timings, compiler diagnostics, source hashes and method limitations. |

## Related general foundations

[PR 70](https://github.com/EngraphCode/open-curriculum-ecosystem/pull/70) carries
the [general data-structure and algorithm survey](https://github.com/EngraphCode/open-curriculum-ecosystem/blob/c5972c61d96f0c2687db5af024936ac83e7b680c/.agent/research/typescript-data-structures-and-algorithms-2026-09-07.md):
research into useful atoms and foundational building blocks for graph and
non-graph consumers, including native collections, sorting, search, selection,
queues, heaps, ordered containers, caches, disjoint sets and persistence.

The [report's non-graph handoff](typescript-graph-foundations-report-2026-09-07.md#12-precise-non-graph-handoff-reconciled-with-pr-70)
contributes graph-specific requirements for those general foundations, including
equality, ordering, ownership, snapshots and resource bounds. General-foundation
findings in turn inform graph mechanisms and composition contracts. The two
research efforts inform each other; exact designs and package boundaries remain
decisions for their owning capabilities under the governing policy.
The document link preserves the inspected survey snapshot; PR 70 carries its
subsequent updates and the link back to this research.

## Status and provenance

This record preserves the research's recommendations, evidence limits and
evaluation checks at its stated cutoff. Its inclusion establishes no implemented
or qualified capability. The current implementation-origin decision is recorded
in [ADR-229](../../../docs/architecture/architectural-decisions/229-own-built-algorithm-and-data-structure-foundations.md).

The research inspected OCE at
[`dfe92492711f8d7c6ac8233735994c8fada45e0e`](https://github.com/EngraphCode/open-curriculum-ecosystem/commit/dfe92492711f8d7c6ac8233735994c8fada45e0e).
Its observations about [PR 70](https://github.com/EngraphCode/open-curriculum-ecosystem/pull/70),
including its draft status and checks, describe the research cutoff and pinned
head in the report. They are historical evidence, not a live status feed.

The commissioned brief and concept-map reference are provenance inputs. The
report includes the governing scope, criteria and definitions needed to read it
independently; reproduction uses the files here and a separate pinned OCE
checkout, with no dependency on the original conversation.

The source bundle and recorded evidence are preserved byte-for-byte. An archived
compiler diagnostic contains original research workspace paths; these are
literal diagnostic text, not paths required to reproduce the probes. The report
has two editorial clarifications for repository inclusion: its authority line
and the wording identifying RDF conformance as a recommendation. One evidence-table
phrase uses "interfaces" in place of "APIs" to avoid a false positive in the
repository's secret scanner; its meaning is unchanged.
Section 12 now provides navigation to the companion research in PR 70.

## Reproduction

Follow the [reproduction guide](typescript-graph-foundations-reproduction-2026-09-07.md)
from a separate working directory containing the companion files. The guide
verifies bundled source hashes before extraction and identifies the original
runtime, dependency versions and OCE source pin. A successful probe run
reproduces recorded observations, including defects; it does not certify an
upstream package or establish universal performance superiority.
