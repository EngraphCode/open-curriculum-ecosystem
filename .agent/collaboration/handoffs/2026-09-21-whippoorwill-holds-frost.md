# Whippoorwill holds Frost: terminal handoff

Date: 2026-09-21. Owner ended the session at 18:35:35Z: full handoff, then enough
for today. This is a **retirement record**, not a request to restart a team seat.

## Identity and boundary

- Platform/model: `copilot` / `gpt-6-astra`.
- App session: `1e8a53c2-196d-4ca2-9469-8f8ca586cb6d`.
- Practice name/prefix: Whippoorwill holds Frost / `1e8a53`.
- Collaboration routing UUID: `ee299b8b-04df-5e66-b1c6-c3412d917f42`.
- Role: sparingly used, cross-model Cricket for Zephyr guards Leeward and Brazier
  spins Temper. No Director authority, implementation lane or commit authority.
- Owner separately authorised executable setup, a session-local waiter, and
  repository capture of its methods. Those permissions did not authorise general
  Practice changes or repository commits.
- Closeout owner for shared work: Zephyr guards Leeward (`281e44`). This seat leaves
  a boundary record; it does not rewrite peer-staged repo continuity or the ledger.

**Late boundary update:** Zephyr's event
`1668cd6d-dcf1-4a70-a372-0ff20065a85e` at 18:38:44Z says that seat is now paused
at the owner's word, possibly for several days. Do not wake it for this handoff
or presume it will land new files today. The formation letter and this record
remain local, uncommitted closeout additions; their later custody belongs to
the owner or an explicitly resumed coordination seat. Zephyr's earlier
"no uncommitted file" snapshot predates these additions and no longer describes
the whole checkout.

## Landed outcome and safety evidence

The requested second-opinion seat was established and used once. Its adversarial
verdict found three framing defects in the shared Practice definition and plan.
Zephyr's content-bearing acknowledgement
`55cff954-2e5d-49fe-aec5-d5003e02c3d4` says all three were accepted and the text changed.
The methods report preserves the verdict verbatim; this is peer-reported disposition,
not an independent audit of every ensuing change.

The owner-requested methods record is
[the Copilot comms report](../../reports/agentic-engineering/copilot-agent-comms-delivery-whippoorwill-holds-frost-2026-09-21.md).
Zephyr committed it at SHA:574aae293003d392be122e8b26dd231b28c7e4d9.
At write-time, `gh pr view 175 --repo EngraphCode/open-curriculum-ecosystem`
reported that exact live head on open draft PR #175, base `engraph`.
Local `HEAD` and the remote-containing branch check agreed. Thus the **methods
report** is committed, pushed and on a PR; it is not merged or official doctrine.

Exact branch-status header from `git -c core.fsmonitor=false status --branch --short`:

```text
## coordination/2026-09-21-56bd4d
```

No upstream is configured: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name '@{u}'`
refused with `fatal: no upstream configured for branch 'coordination/2026-09-21-56bd4d'`.
There is consequently no upstream ahead/behind count to quote. Do not turn the
absence of that count into "all work pushed": the live PR-head comparison proves
the report landing only.

At this check, peer-staged work remained in the exchange ARC, napkin, repo continuity,
review-cost ledger, context-loop report, and Zephyr's formation letter. None was
staged, unstaged or altered by this seat. This handoff is a local coordination
record; the new formation letter is not committed by this seat. Route it to the
existing closeout owner rather than creating a handover commit or PR.

## Delivery evidence: do not collapse the layers

| Layer | Observation | What it does not prove |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Disk and persistent monitor | Directed events were buffered; canonical liveness assertions passed | Agent attention or idle reasoning |
| Owner-triggered consumption | Round-trip message read about 18:09:15Z after the 18:09:08Z owner prompt | Automatic wake |
| Scheduled reasoning | Automation-labelled prompts at 18:10:13Z and 18:13:13Z caused sweeps | Exact cadence or every later tick |
| One-shot adapter | Detected events, persisted batches, exited and was rearmed | Idle reasoning from completion alone |
| Useful participation | One Cricket verdict received an explicit acceptance/disposition message | Reliable unattended delivery |

The 18:13 scheduled sweep picked up the substantive request, but an owner waiter
request interrupted before the 18:14:59 reply. The whole response interval is not
an uncontaminated automatic-latency measurement. Zephyr's later record request was
detected about 18:20:00Z during an already-active owner documentation turn.

At wrap, the app's automation record had `updatedAt: 18:27:12.023Z` and a future
`nextRunAt`, but `lastRunAt` still named the earlier 18:13 tick. There was no
corresponding new reasoning turn in this context. Scheduler metadata alone is
not another successful wake, nor enough evidence to diagnose a failed tick.
No claim that the ten-minute recovery path fired successfully is made.

## Shutdown and resumption boundary

Owner stop overrides the five-idle-check retirement rule. Retirement announcement:
`17f809c3-1625-44a8-9a7e-ab20428be274`. The ten-minute automation was cleared through
the app API and one-shot shell `cricket-waiter-4` was stopped. No replacement may
be launched under the old instructions. The canonical `cricket-comms` watcher
must be stopped last, after the final handoff event; final verification is recorded
below. No outgoing heartbeat was ever armed; do not fabricate a heartbeat-end.

The short report-edit claim was closed. The only wrap claim covers this handoff
and the formation letter; close it before the final departure event. No source
claim or commit queue entry belongs to this seat.

**Resume only on new owner direction.** Start from the methods report, this record,
current canonical comms and actual app process/automation state. Derive the current
session identity and supervisor again; historical PIDs and shell handles are not
portable. Do not infer that processes survived a boundary. Do not call `init` on
an existing waiter baseline: read any pending batch before acknowledgement.

## Index of homes and deliberately local material

- Durable design, exact acknowledgement/replay algorithm, commands, limitations and
  evidence: [methods report](../../reports/agentic-engineering/copilot-agent-comms-delivery-whippoorwill-holds-frost-2026-09-21.md).
- Earlier architecture context, dated and not revalidated here:
  [first-class Copilot support](../../reports/agentic-engineering/first-class-copilot-cli-practice-support-2026-07-24.md).
- Formation letter:
  [A message is not attention](../../experience/2026-09-21-whippoorwill-holds-frost-a-message-is-not-attention.md).
- Canonical local events: `.agent/state/collaboration/comms/`; the report retains
  the seven key authored event bodies because this stream is not a tracked archive.
- Exact experimental source, tests and waiter state:
  `~/.copilot/session-state/1e8a53c2-196d-4ca2-9469-8f8ca586cb6d/files/`.
  Files: `cricket_waiter.py`, `test_cricket_waiter.py`, `cricket-waiter/`.
  Source fingerprints are in the report. These files remain local evidence,
  not shipped tooling; session deletion may remove access to them. The full
  behavioural algorithm survives in the report even if the prototype does not.
- Same-session SQL: `cricket_watch_state`, including distinct scheduler-wake,
  waiter-detection and idle-wake flags. Not a cross-session authority.

Do not copy local paths, the original model or the Codex-named seed input into
permanent Copilot doctrine. The seed workaround retained the honest `copilot`
platform label; native Copilot identity support still needs an explicit design.

## Open work and promises

| Commitment | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| Join as interactive Cricket | Fulfilled; now retired at owner direction |
| Wait for the one exact challenge rather than pre-reviewing drafts | Fulfilled |
| Return a bounded adversarial judgement | Fulfilled; peer accepted all three points |
| Build the waiter and ten-minute fallback | Fulfilled as experiment; stopped at owner direction |
| Record methods in the repository | Fulfilled; committed/pushed on PR #175 |
| Tell Zephyr when idle wake is settled | No settling observation exists. Forwarded as an open experiment, not an active promise to keep this session running |
| Full handoff and shutdown | This record and final departure verification |

Next experiment, **only if the owner resumes the work**: send a peer event while
the receiver is genuinely idle, away from a fallback tick and without an owner
prompt. Record creation, detection/exit, notification, reasoning start and
absorption separately. Zephyr is the named recipient for any later result, or a
future Copilot-support owner should carry it if Zephyr has retired.

Peer-reported Git issue: Zephyr attributed shared-checkout hangs to different Git
builds running fsmonitor daemons. This seat did not verify causality and did not
kill either daemon. Subsequent commands used `git -c core.fsmonitor=false`, without
changing repository configuration. Preserve the qualification; do not generalise
it into a proven Copilot defect.

## Review cost and consolidation disposition

The supported command was
`node agent-tools/dist/src/bin/agent-tools.js review-cost survey --since 2026-09-21 --repo EngraphCode/open-curriculum-ecosystem`.
It accepts a date, not an ISO timestamp. Relevant result: PR #175, OPEN, zero
review rounds, settlement cost 0, budget 40 (two pushes), verdict within.
Seat reading: no review loop to stop; gate has not fired early or late.
Other rows returned by the date survey are not this seat's work. Route this
result to Zephyr's already-staged ledger rather than double-counting the same PR.

No doctrine was graduated. Within this boundary, no deep-consolidation trigger
requires new work: the method and rationale already have a committed home,
the remaining runtime claims lack evidence, and no formal delivery milestone
was closed. Unrelated shared buffers remain the closeout owner's responsibility.
A broader retrospective is a possible future owner-directed activity, not a new
session, agent or work programme launched during shutdown.

## Loss scan and metaloss fixed point

Pass one found three ways a future reader could overclaim: the report was initially
only on disk but is now provably on the PR; a process exit was easy to mistake for
idle reasoning; and the supposedly autonomous challenge reply included an owner
interruption. The report and evidence table preserve those distinctions.

Pass two found losses in the scan itself: the ten-minute timer metadata is not
proof of a reasoning turn; a PID/status file is not proof of responsiveness;
the exact Python source is only session-local; and a future "rearm" instruction
could outlive today's explicit owner stop. The homes index, runtime limitations
and resume-only-on-new-direction block preserve these boundaries. The promise to
report a conclusive wake result is explicitly left unfulfilled, not silently
converted into a reliability claim.

Attribution check: acceptance of the verdict and fsmonitor contention are
peer-reported; the owner request, tool outputs, report commit and live PR head
were observed directly. No fenced owner wording was identified in this session's
authored records; no secrets or private credentials were copied.

External bound: this scan cannot certify its own completeness. Earlier context is
partly summarised, unobserved runtime behaviour remains unknown, and the code
review checked the adapter, not the app scheduler. The concrete outside-correction
signature was the owner's question about notification versus attention: it changed
the mechanism without proving the final hop. A third pass only re-finds these
named evidence and retention limits; the recursion closes here.

These findings are forwarded in the departure event for the next owner-directed
coordination pickup's napkin/continuity capture. Zephyr has paused; no absorption
is claimed and this seat does not overwrite the shared surfaces at retirement.

## Final departure verification

Pending final canonical announcement and watcher-last shutdown. This section will
be replaced with observed outcomes before the owner-facing closeout.
