# Draft for the owner: findings on upstream's 1.181.2–1.181.3 changes, surfaced by the fork's sync review

**Review contract.** Purpose: give the owner one paste-ready note for upstream's maintainers,
naming the findings a downstream review round surfaced on upstream-authored files while
integrating releases 1.181.2 and 1.181.3 (fork PR #147, 2026-09-15). Intended impact: upstream
decides whether to cure; the fork cures none of these, because it never diverges upstream code on
a sync. Questions for a reviewer: is each of the eight findings stated accurately against
upstream's code at `c67d33c8a`, and is anything fork-specific mislabelled as upstream's? Evidence
standard: each finding cites the file and line the reviewer named and is reproducible from
upstream's tree at that tip. Authority boundary: this note is the owner's to send, edit or drop;
it names no fork surface, branch or organisation. Non-goals: no cure proposals beyond the
reviewers' own words; no claim about severity beyond what the code shows. A successful review
confirms that each finding reproduces, or marks it withdrawn.

## The note (paste-ready; the owner edits freely)

Hi — while integrating 1.181.2 → 1.181.3 downstream, automated review rounds and our own read raised eight
points on files that came in with those releases. None were changed on our side; passing them on
in case they are useful.

1. `packages/sdks/oak-sdk-codegen/code-generation/typegen/cross-domain-constants.ts` (around line
   40): the new closed widget-address vocabulary is typed `readonly string[]`, which discards the
   exact literal union. Keeping the source tuple literal with `as const` would let consumers keep
   the finite contract, as `docs/governance/typescript-practice.md` asks.
2. `packages/sdks/oak-sdk-codegen/code-generation/typegen/generate-widget-constants.ts` (around line
   56): the generator emits the same widened list in its public output even if the source tuple is
   exact. Emitting the generated list with `as const` would preserve the literal vocabulary in the
   generated API.
3. `packages/sdks/oak-sdk-codegen/eslint.config.ts` (around line 120): the typegen environment guard
   does not ban every direct `process` route it describes. `globalThis['process'].env.VERCEL` has no
   `Identifier[name="process"]`, import or `require`, so it stays lint-clean while making generated
   output deployment-dependent. Covering computed `globalThis` access, with a regression test, or
   narrowing the "whole route" wording to what the selectors guarantee, would close it.
4. `docs/operations/production-debugging-runbook.md` (around line 546): the instruction compares
   status codes, but status equality does not distinguish route handling from an edge block. If the
   edge rejects both requests, both can be 403 without `x-vercel-id`. The preceding text already
   names `x-vercel-id` as the discriminator, so comparing that header would match it.
5. `apps/oak-curriculum-mcp-streamable-http/e2e-tests/mcp-app-composition.e2e.test.ts` (around line
   192): the retired-address checks run several protocol reads inside one test case, so a failure
   on the first retired address stops every later address being exercised or reported. The same
   loop shape appears in the newly added router test. Parameterised cases (`it.each` over the
   retired addresses) would isolate each one, as the repository's immediate-fail list for loops
   with side effects in test functions asks.
6. `docs/architecture/architectural-decisions/141-mcp-apps-standard-primary.md` (around line 257):
   the "Source of truth" paragraph still names
   `packages/sdks/oak-sdk-codegen/code-generation/typegen/widget-uri-suffix.ts` as the pure
   resolver, but that file and its unit test were deleted when the widget address was versioned.
   Pointing the paragraph at the generator that now owns the address would keep the ADR true.
7. `packages/sdks/oak-sdk-codegen/code-generation/typegen/cross-domain-constants.ts` (around line
   37): `RETIRED_WIDGET_URIS` lists `oak-curriculum-app-899803c6` and `oak-curriculum-app-5ce56c4b`,
   but the production UAT report `apps/oak-curriculum-mcp-streamable-http/docs/uat-reports/2026-08-04-prod.md`
   (around lines 69 to 73) records `ui://widget/oak-curriculum-app-85820fb2.html` as an address a
   production `resources/list` advertised. A client that kept that list would still meet the
   authentication challenge the allowlist exists to avoid. Inventorying every production address
   clients may have retained, rather than the two most recent, would close it.
8. `.agent/reports/mcp-agent-facing-content-audit/registry.json` (item C479, `BASE_WIDGET_URI`,
   around line 10978): the `behavioural_intent` still reads "the cache-busting hash forces hosts to
   reload a fresh bundle", while the constant is now the fixed `oak-curriculum-app-v1` address and
   ADR-141 describes versioned, never hashed, addresses. Regenerated audit pages therefore show the
   `-v1` excerpt beside a purpose that contradicts it. Correcting the intent at its source would
   make the regenerated surfaces agree.

## Provenance

Items 1 to 5 come from fork PR #147's review round one at head `c67d33c8a`: Copilot review threads
on items 1 to 4, and a Codex review thread on item 5. Each thread is dispositioned on the pull
request as routed to this draft. Item 6 comes from the fork's premise sweep of the same sync,
reading upstream's ADR-141 at `c67d33c8a` against the files the release deleted. Items 7 and 8 come from
the round-two Copilot review of the integration head `15de4bc69`; the same round re-raised item 3.
