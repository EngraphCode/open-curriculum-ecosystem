# Why the register stayed at twelve for three days, and what emptied it in seventy-five minutes

**Date**: 2026-09-20. **Author**: Zephyr guards Leeward (281e44), the seat whose arc this is, at
the owner's word. **Arc**: the owner's dedicated consolidation session, 2026-09-16 to
2026-09-19, five contexts of one seat. **Modes**: metacognition (retrospective) and reason,
throughout; a bounded free-play pass is in the napkin block of the same date. **Status of the
arc**: the drain is done and pushed; draft #156, which carries it, is not yet merged, so the
cured segment's review cost is still unpaid and is stated here as a prediction, not a result.

The owner's question, 2026-09-19, verbatim: "how is it, when the only job I gave you was to
drain the buffers, they are still critical 2 days later?"

## Timeline, from primary sources

Instants are commit times in UTC, read from `git log` on 2026-09-20; merges are first-parent on
`origin/engraph`; review figures are the rows of `review-cost-ledger.md`.

| When (UTC) | Event | Register entries (directive-bound) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-09-16 21:39 | #150 folded, `SHA:a07940ac9`, three rounds; the consolidation's first context opens on it | 11 |
| 2026-09-16 21:43 | the napkin, comms and letters graduated, `SHA:63b544464` | 11 |
| 2026-09-17 15:09 | #152 folded, `SHA:cd847a2b3`; a pre-publication pass (31 findings) and three rounds (21) | 11 |
| 2026-09-17 15:34 | the owner's lifecycle decision registered, `SHA:1bebadf58` | 12 |
| 2026-09-17 18:36 | fourth context opens; the meter reads 13.3 %; the seat declares "fold here, directives here" | 12 |
| 2026-09-17 20:17 | #153 folded, `SHA:b5b0e70cd`; a pre-publication pass (33) and three rounds (13 distinct) | 12 |
| 2026-09-17 ~20:2x | the meter reads 51 % at the directive step; the pass is put to the owner | 12 |
| 2026-09-19 11:30 | #155 folded, `SHA:65a929d9a`; its content was records about #153; 15 and 8 findings | 12 |
| 2026-09-19 ~15:3x | the owner's question; then "drain the buffers to zero, do not mess about with coordination branches" | 12 |
| 2026-09-19 15:47 | fifth context, opened at 11 %: the napkin graduated and rotated, `SHA:668d75378` | 12 |
| 2026-09-19 16:06 | eight entries graduated, `SHA:f6ce4d0c3` | 4 |
| 2026-09-19 16:1x to 19:3x | the meter reads 32.4 %; the seat stops at the 30 % rule and cards the owner; the answer (override) arrives about three hours later | 4 |
| 2026-09-19 19:38 | three entries graduated, `SHA:28e8b73be` | 1 |
| 2026-09-19 19:47 | the last entry leaves, `SHA:d3c81c0b2`; all four drainable buffers read empty | 0 |

Derived: the four folds drew 52, 46, 23 and 12 findings (pre-publication plus review, from the
ledger rows for #152, #153, #155 and #150), about 130 in all, all but a handful recorded as true (the ledger records one rejected on
#152, and #150's round two a refusal and a withdrawn item). None
of them concerned a register entry. The register moved from twelve to zero in two working
stretches of the fifth context, 15:41Z to about 16:10Z and 19:35Z to 19:47Z: about forty
minutes of directive work, seventy-five with the napkin and the two record files that followed.

## The causal stack

**Technical root: the job's last step was gated on a budget that every earlier step spent.** All
twelve entries targeted `.agent/directives/`, and `directive-file-context-budget` admits
directive edits only below 30 % context. The consolidation's doctrine orders work raw sources
first and directives last. So the one measure the owner cared about sat behind everything that
consumes context, under a gate that closes as context is consumed. Evidence: the first context
reached its directive boundary above 30 %; the third read 29.5 % straight after a compaction; the
fourth went from 13.3 % to 51 % without a directive edit.

**Process root: the work rode a branch with a clock, and the clock fed itself.** The
consolidation committed onto the coordination branch, whose 24-hour lifetime rule forces a fold
each UTC day. A fold carrying doctrine earns a pre-publication pass and three review rounds; the
cures and the rotation records they require are themselves claim-bearing text; that text is the
next fold's content. #155's whole content was records about folding #153, and it drew
twenty-three findings. `coordination-fold` precondition 3 already said a work product with its
own review contract belongs on its own lane; the seat had read it and placed the work on the
branch anyway, because the live memory estate (napkin, registers, thread records) rides that
branch and the consolidation edits exactly those files. The placement rule and the location of
the files pull in opposite directions, and nothing says which wins.

**Meta root: an obligation with a deadline and a ceremony outcompetes a job with neither.** The
fold had a due time, a skill, a checklist and a visible terminal state (a merge). The register
had a count and no clock. At each pickup the seat ranked by urgency, did the due thing, and
reported in its currency: merges landed, findings cured. Those reports were true and read as
progress, to the seat as much as to the owner. The estate has a name for the cover
(`legitimate-principle-as-avoidance-cover`: a real principle invoked for not doing the work) and
the consolidation skill names the deferral shape; both were loaded. What the estate did not
have words for is the selection mechanism underneath: **clocked obligations starve unclocked
jobs**, and they do it without anyone deciding to, because each individual choice ("the branch
is DUE, fold it") is correct by its own rule.

**The layer below that: the collision was never put to the owner in the owner's terms.** Two
standing obligations competed for one budget from the first context. The seat surfaced
questions about means (a fresh context or an override? fold now or at the rollover?) and never
the question those stood for: "the daily fold will consume the context the register needs; for
this job, which gives way?" When the owner removed the competing obligation, in one sentence,
the job took forty minutes. The next "why" (why a seat asks about means) leaves the arc; the
2026-09-16 retrospective, `why-written-lessons-kept-needing-the-owner-2026-09-16.md`, is its
record, and this arc is one more instance of its title.

## The counterfactual test

The strongest counterfactual is a segment of the same arc: the fifth context. Same seat, same
entries, same 30 % rule, same branch. What differed: no fold (the owner's word), texts already
drafted (written in the fourth context and conserved in its handoff record), and the count
stated first in every report. Uncured: about sixty-six hours elapsed (2026-09-16 21:39Z to
2026-09-19 15:40Z), four folds, about 130 findings, 25 commits (`git rev-list --count
--no-merges` over that window), zero entries moved. Cured: about four and a half hours elapsed
(three of them waiting on one card), five commits, twelve entries and the napkin.

When could it have gone right? At 2026-09-17 18:36Z. The meter read 13.3 %, the texts could
have been drafted and applied that evening, and #153's fold could have followed. The seat
chose the fold first because another seat's landing slot waited on it, which was a real reason
and the owner had said to fold; but it then read six directives during the fold's waits and
spent the headroom twice. Pricing the two acts at 18:36Z (the fold's three rounds against the
directive pass's reads) would have shown they did not both fit.

Two honest limits on the comparison. The fifth context did not start from nothing: the drafts
it applied were the fourth context's work, so some of the "wasted" reading paid. And the cured
segment has not yet been reviewed: draft #156 now carries twelve directive graduations, a
lifecycle change across forty-seven files and two Core amendments on a coordination branch,
which is precondition 3's own worked failure at a larger size. Its cost is deferred, not avoided.

## Honest credit

The three days bought real things: the pre-publication claim pass, proved three times (31, 33
and 15 true findings caught before a reviewer saw them); the PDR-117 and PDR-141 amendments;
frictions F-189 to F-195 and the fsmonitor cure they led to; the owner's carrier rule in one
sentence; two verifier lenses; the lifecycle question that produced the owner's "Graduate, then
archive" decision, asked in the second context because the seat read before it moved; and the
drafts that made the fifth context fast. The records are truer than they were. None of it was
the job, and the credit does not excuse the price: the owner had to ask.

## Proposals, each with warrant, falsifier and lane

1. **Report the job's own measure first; name work that does not move it.** Landed 2026-09-19
   in `user-collaboration.md` and `consolidate-until-done` step 7 (fast lane). Warrant: the
   fifth context, where the count made a non-moving turn visible at once. Falsifier: a job with
   the measure stated first still runs a day without the measure moving and without the seat
   saying so.
2. **Price the pass at open, and reserve the last step's price.** The pricing half landed
   2026-09-20 in `consolidate-until-done` step 7; the reservation is added with this record: the
   directive step's cost (the bytes of the directives to be read whole, over four, plus the
   edits) is set aside at open, and earlier stages stop when headroom reaches it (fast lane).
   Warrant: four contexts that each reached the gate spent. Falsifier: a pass that reserved
   still reaches its directive step over the line.
3. **Clocked obligations starve unclocked jobs: surface the collision once, in the owner's
   terms.** Candidate principle, constitutional-class, to the slow-lane register: when a
   standing rule with a deadline will consume the budget of the owner's stated job, the seat
   puts that one collision to the owner at its first occurrence, as a question about ends, and
   does not resolve it by obeying whichever obligation is due. It composes with
   `principles.md` §Owner Direction Beats Plan, which already says to surface conflicts, and
   with `present-verdicts-not-menus`'s wording screen. Prediction by review: the next dedicated
   consolidation that meets a DUE fold surfaces the collision in its first context and moves
   its measure in that context. Falsifier: it surfaces the collision and the measure still does
   not move, or no such collision occurs by the review date and the row is killed as untested.
   Review: 2026-12-20, first consolidation on or after.
4. **Test the deferred cost now.** Prediction, recorded before the fact: draft #156, carrying
   doctrine on the coordination branch, draws twenty or more findings across its
   pre-publication pass and review, and exceeds a budget of two settlement pushes unless its
   class is declared and its rounds expected. Falsifier: ten or fewer findings in all. Either
   result is evidence about precondition 3 at the size the owner's single-branch word produced;
   the fold's ledger row records it (fast lane: no text changes until the result is in).

Not proposed: a change to the 24-hour lifetime rule. The owner deferred one fold for one job by
word; that is one instance, and `one-instance-is-an-observation` holds. The observation is in
the napkin: the lifetime rule and the context loop's safety valve are the same shape, a timer
that reads silence as an ending, and each met a case where a second input would have told
"blocked" from "done".

## The launch prompt, read against this arc (the owner's ask, 2026-09-20)

The prompt that opened every context of this arc is
`.agent/prompts/agentic-engineering/dedicated-consolidation-session.md` (the owner's scratchpad,
mid-edit on 2026-09-20; read, not edited, by this seat). Read against what happened:

- **It invokes six skills on its first line and names two more in its body.**
  `start-right-thorough`, `metacognition`, `free-play`, `concept-exploration`, `parallax` and
  `consolidate-until-done` load at open, and `retrospective` and `consolidate-docs` are asked
  about. The grounding read is large by the estate's own measure (the 2026-09-10 directives-tier
  review put the mandated read at about 237,000 characters before the rules tier). Every one of those
  bodies is paid for out of the headroom the directive step needed, before any work. The
  skill it ends on already wraps its own grounding and `consolidate-docs`. The prompt was the
  first thing to spend the budget whose exhaustion this record is about.
- **Its three open questions ask for a procedure each session.** "Should a retrospective be run
  first? Should the parallax skills be applied? Are we still on target to fulfil
  consolidate-docs?" have stable answers (a retrospective when a finished arc surprised;
  parallax at a real fork, at screening depth; the third is the skill's completion contract).
  They now live in `consolidate-until-done` grounding step 8, decided once, loaded when they
  fire.
- **Its ordering advice and its subagent warning duplicate the skill** (work loop step 2;
  §Approach), and its concept-node sentence duplicates `consolidate-docs`'s graduation-target
  list. Its
  tombstone sentence is the always-applied rule `no-tombstones-for-removed-ideas`. Its team
  line is a conditional the skill now carries (step 8). Duplicates in a prompt drift from their
  homes: the prompt said "it may be a good idea" to start raw-first while the skill says the
  flow is the organising axis.
- **What only the prompt can say is the owner's voice for the day, and it says most of it
  well**: the goal is curation and never numbers; done means empty pending graduations and empty
  buffers. What it did not say, and what ended the arc when the owner did say it, is what this
  job outranks.

So the refinement is subtraction. A prompt of this size would have carried everything the arc
needed and nothing the skills already hold:

```text
/goal ultrathink /oak-consolidate-until-done

This is a dedicated consolidation session. The goal is knowledge curation, never fitness
numbers. Done means empty pending graduations and empty buffers: say those counts first in
every report. This job outranks the daily branch fold; if the two collide, ask me once which
gives way.
```

The last sentence is the owner's to keep or cut; it is proposal 3 stated as a standing word for
this job, which is the one place a prompt beats a skill: a skill can tell a seat to ask, only
the owner can answer in advance. Warrant for the whole change: this arc, where the one-line
instruction of 2026-09-19 did what the full prompt had not. Falsifier: a consolidation launched
from the short prompt misses something the long one would have supplied; that thing then
belongs in the skill, and the prompt stays short.

**Addendum, 2026-09-20, later the same day.** The owner adopted the short prompt and had this
seat write it into the file, with the last sentence in the owner's own words: "This job is
higher priority than the daily branch fold." That is a standing answer, given in advance, to
the collision proposal 3 names; the sentences above saying the file was left as the owner had
it describe the record's first writing.

## Success test

The causal stack names a mechanism the estate had no words for (clocked obligations starve
unclocked jobs) and distinguishes it from the cover pattern it sits under. Two proposals are
landed, one is registered with a prediction and a review date, and one is a dated prediction the
next fold confirms or refutes. If proposal 3's row is untouched at its review and proposal 4's
result is never written on the ledger, this record was a eulogy.
