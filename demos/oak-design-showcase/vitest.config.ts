/**
 * Vitest configuration for the design-showcase demo (hub precedent).
 *
 * Component tests run under `happy-dom`; tests live beside the code they
 * prove, named by explicit convention (testing-strategy §Pattern 2).
 * Playwright specs under `tests/` are excluded — they run via `test:ui` /
 * `test:a11y`, never under vitest. No `globals`: tests import their vitest
 * API explicitly, so the type-checker sees exactly what the runtime
 * provides.
 *
 * Tests never do IO: happy-dom loads a `<link rel="stylesheet">` for real
 * by default, so a test that appends a link with any href fires an
 * unawaited fetch to the window's default origin (localhost port 3000)
 * whose refusal lands as an unhandled error at random. Stylesheet file
 * loading is therefore disabled for every test this config runs, and a
 * disabled load is handled as success: an href-bearing link receives a
 * synthetic `load` event and no report, instead of a `NotSupportedError`
 * on the window's virtual console and an `error` event. Tests that exercise
 * load observers append links without an href so no synthetic event can
 * stand in for the one they dispatch themselves; the product's own
 * href-bearing links (the identity switchboard specimen, the tokens page)
 * load cleanly and offline when a component test renders them. The guard
 * that proves this setting bites is `tools/unit-suite-no-stylesheet-loading.unit.test.ts`.
